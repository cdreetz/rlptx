when i ran the benchmark indirectly with the cuda kernel and benchmark script with nvcc gemm4x4_1d_tiled.cu benchmark_gemm4x4_1d_tiled_generated.cu -o benchmark, it says avg time is 0.00518 ms

but when i ran the direct benchmark on the generated ptx it returned 0.00172 ms ??

Let me explain the key differences between the two benchmarking approaches:
Previous Benchmark (CUDA Runtime API):
Used CUDA Runtime API (cudaMemcpy, cudaMalloc, etc.)
Had to compile the CUDA kernel at runtime
Included kernel compilation overhead in timing
Used cudaDeviceSynchronize() for synchronization
Current Benchmark (CUDA Driver API):
Uses CUDA Driver API (cuMemcpy, cuMemAlloc, etc.)
Loads pre-compiled PTX directly
No kernel compilation overhead
Uses cuCtxSynchronize() for synchronization
More direct control over the GPU execution
The main reason for the speed difference is that the current benchmark:
Loads the PTX directly without any compilation overhead
Uses the Driver API which has less overhead than the Runtime API
Has a more efficient synchronization mechanism

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by understanding what this entails.

First, the operation is matrix multiplication. So, the first tensor is of shape (M, K), and the second is (K, N). The result should be a tensor of shape (M, N). Each element in the result is the sum of the products of elements from the rows of the first matrix and the columns of the second matrix.

Now, thinking about how to implement this in Triton. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA, but with more abstraction. The key is to structure the kernel to efficiently process the matrices using shared memory and proper memory access patterns.

Let me recall the steps for matrix multiplication in Triton. Typically, you split the matrices into blocks. For each block, you compute the dot product of the corresponding rows and columns. The block size is usually chosen to be a power of two, like 32 or 64, to optimize cache usage.

So, the first thing is to determine the block size. Let's say BLOCK_SIZE is 32. Then, for each block, we'll process a submatrix of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). But wait, the matrices are (M, K) and (K, N). So, the first matrix's rows are of size K, and the second matrix's columns are of size K. So, the block size needs to be such that we can process K elements in a block.

Wait, maybe I should think about how to split the matrices into tiles. For the first matrix (M, K), each row is of length K. So, if we take a block size of, say, 32, then each row can be split into multiple blocks. Similarly for the second matrix (K, N), each column is of length K.

But in matrix multiplication, the inner loop is over the K elements. So, for each element in the result matrix (i, j), we compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, the inner loop is over k, which is the dimension that's being summed over.

In Triton, the kernel is typically written with a loop over the rows of the first matrix and columns of the second matrix. But since we're using shared memory, we need to load the necessary elements into shared memory and then perform the dot product.

So, the kernel will have three main loops: one for the rows of the first matrix, one for the columns of the second matrix, and one for the inner dimension (k). However, in Triton, it's more efficient to use a block-level loop structure, where each thread handles a specific element in the result matrix.

Wait, maybe the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element of the result matrix. But that might not be efficient because of the inner loop over k. So, perhaps using a block-level approach where each block handles a tile of the matrices.

Alternatively, for each row in the first matrix and each column in the second matrix, we compute the dot product. So, the kernel would have two main loops: one over the rows (i) and one over the columns (j). For each (i, j), we compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a single loop that iterates over the elements of the result matrix. However, given that the matrices are large, we need to process them in blocks.

Let me think about the memory layout. The first matrix is (M, K), and the second is (K, N). Each element in the first matrix is accessed as A[i][k], and in the second matrix as B[k][j]. So, for each (i, j), the sum is over k from 0 to K-1.

Now, for the Triton kernel, we need to determine the number of threads per block. Let's say we have a block size of 32. Then, each thread would handle a specific (i, j) pair. But that might not be efficient because the inner loop (over k) would be handled by the thread. However, with K possibly being large, this could lead to a lot of operations per thread.

Alternatively, using a block-level approach where each block handles a tile of the matrices. For example, each block handles a tile of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) from the first matrix and (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) from the second matrix. Then, the block computes the dot product for each element in the result matrix.

But how to structure this? Let me think. The first matrix is (M, K), and the second is (K, N). So, for each block, we can load a block of rows from

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works. The result should be a tensor of shape [M, N], where each element (i, j) is the sum of the products of elements from the first matrix's row i and the second matrix's column j.

First, I should think about the GPU operations required. Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for parallelism, so I need to structure the kernel to handle this efficiently. The key here is to use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency. 

The input tensors are A (M, K) and B (K, N). The output is C (M, N). For each element in C, we need to compute the dot product of the i-th row of A and the j-th column of B. 

In Triton, I'll need to define the kernel with parameters for the input and output tensors, along with their shapes. The kernel will be launched with the number of rows (M) and columns (N) for the output. 

Next, I need to determine the block sizes. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 is common. Let me choose 32 as the block size. Each thread block will handle a portion of the rows and columns. 

Each thread in the block will compute one element of the output matrix. But since the computation involves a dot product over K elements, I need to make sure that the threads can efficiently access the elements of A and B. 

For shared memory, I'll need to load the rows of A and columns of B into shared memory. Since each thread in the block will handle a different element of the output, I need to partition the K elements into chunks that can be processed by the threads. 

Wait, maybe I should split the K dimension into blocks. For example, if K is 1024, then each block can handle 32 elements. Each thread in the block will handle a part of the K dimension. But how to structure that?

Alternatively, each thread can be responsible for a particular element in the output. For each element C[i][j], the thread needs to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. 

But in Triton, each thread is responsible for a specific (i, j) pair. However, since K can be large, we need to compute the sum efficiently. 

So, the steps for each thread would be:

1. Load the row i of A into shared memory.
2. Load the column j of B into shared memory.
3. Compute the dot product of these two vectors (each of length K) and store the result in C[i][j].

But loading the entire row and column into shared memory might be memory-intensive. Instead, perhaps we can use a block size that allows each thread to handle a chunk of the K dimension. 

Alternatively, since each thread is responsible for a single element in the output, the number of threads per block would be M * N, but that's not feasible for large M and N. So, we need to use a more efficient approach.

Wait, maybe I should structure the kernel such that each thread block handles a block of rows and columns. For example, each block processes a certain number of rows (M_block) and columns (N_block), and each thread in the block computes a single element of the output. However, this might not be efficient for all cases. 

Alternatively, using a more standard approach for matrix multiplication with Triton, where each thread block handles a block of rows and columns, and each thread computes a part of the dot product. 

Let me think again. The standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to have each thread block handle a block of rows and columns, and each thread in the block computes a part of the dot product. For example, each thread block handles a block of size (block_rows, block_cols), and each thread computes a part of the dot product. 

But in this case, since the matrices are [M, K] and [K, N], the output is [M, N]. So, the kernel would be structured to process each row of the output matrix. 

Alternatively, using the approach where each thread block handles a block of rows (say, block_rows) and each thread in the block handles a block of columns (block_cols). But this might not be straightforward. 

Alternatively, using the approach where each thread block processes a single row of the output matrix. For example, each thread block handles a row i of the output matrix, and each thread in the block computes a column j of the output matrix. 

Wait, maybe I should look up the standard Triton matrix multiplication kernel. From what I remember, the standard approach is to have each thread block handle a

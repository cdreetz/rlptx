Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum over the columns (since the last dimension is N). So for each row in the tensor, I need to add up all the elements in that row. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding row.

Next, input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor with dimensions M (rows) and N (columns). The output is a 1D tensor with M elements. The memory layout is important here. Since we're dealing with a 2D tensor, it's likely stored in row-major order, which is the default in most frameworks. So each row is stored contiguously in memory.

Now, block sizes and memory access patterns. Triton kernels use warps and threads per warp. For a sum reduction, a common approach is to have each thread handle a single element, but since we need to sum across N elements per row, maybe we can have each thread process a certain number of elements. However, since N can be large, we need to consider how to efficiently access the elements.

Wait, but if each thread is responsible for a single element, then for each row, we need to sum all N elements. But with N possibly being large, that could be inefficient. Alternatively, maybe we can use a block size that allows each thread to process a chunk of elements. But since the sum is over the entire row, maybe we can have each thread handle a single element, and then perform a reduction across the threads in the block.

But how to structure this. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The input tensor is [M, N], and the output is [M]. Each row is processed independently. So for each row, we need to sum all N elements in that row.

So, the kernel should iterate over each row, and for each row, sum all the elements in that row. The kernel should be able to handle multiple rows in parallel.

In Triton, each thread is assigned a unique index. So, perhaps we can have each thread handle a single element in the row. But for a row with N elements, there are N elements. So, if we have a block size of, say, 1024, then each block can handle up to 1024 elements. But since each row has N elements, the number of blocks needed would be ceil(M * N / BLOCK_SIZE). Wait, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can structure the kernel to process each row in a way that each thread handles a single element in that row, and then perform a reduction across the threads in the block.

Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread process a single element in the row, and then each block reduces the sum of its threads. But that would require that each block processes a single row. However, if the row has N elements, and the block size is, say, 1024, then for a row with N elements, each block can process a subset of the elements. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe the kernel can process multiple rows, but that would complicate the reduction.

Wait, maybe I should think of the kernel as processing each row. For each row, the threads in the block can sum the elements in that row. So, for each row, the threads in the block can be assigned to sum different elements in the row. But how to map the threads to the elements.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then the block reduces the sum of all elements in the row. But that would require that each block processes a single row. However, if the row has N elements, then each block would have to process N elements. But if the block size is 1024, then for N=1024, each block can process one row. But for N=2048, each block would process two elements. Wait, but that's not efficient.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed to process each row, and for each row, the threads in the block are responsible for summing the elements. For example, if the block size is 1024, then each block can process up to 1024 elements in a row. But since each row has N elements, the number of blocks needed would be ceil(M * N / BLOCK_SIZE). But that's not efficient.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured to process each row in a way that each thread in the block handles a single element in that row. Then, the block reduces the sum of all elements in the row. But for that, each thread would

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to sum over the columns (since the last dimension is N). So for each row in the tensor, we need to add up all the elements in that row. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding row.

Now, considering GPU operations. Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for parallelism. So I need to figure out how to partition the work across threads. Since each row is independent, each thread can handle a single row. But how many threads per block? Let's think about block size. Maybe using a block size that's a power of two, like 256, but that's up to the user. But for this case, since each row is independent, maybe each thread can process one element in the row. Wait, but if the row has N elements, and each thread is responsible for a single element, then for each row, we need N elements. But that would require a lot of threads. Alternatively, maybe each thread can process a chunk of elements in the row. But since the sum is over all elements in the row, perhaps it's better to have each thread handle a single element, and then accumulate the sum. But that might not be efficient if the row is large. Alternatively, maybe using a reduction approach where each thread processes a group of elements and then reduces them. But since the sum is over the entire row, maybe the simplest approach is to have each thread handle a single element in the row and accumulate the sum.

Wait, but in Triton, each thread is responsible for a single element. So for a row, each thread would take an element from that row and add it to a shared sum. But how to handle that. Let me think.

Let's say the tensor is of shape [M, N]. Each row is of length N. For each row i, we need to sum all elements from column 0 to N-1. So for each row, the sum is the sum of all elements in that row.

In Triton, the kernel will be launched with a certain number of blocks. Each block can process multiple rows. Wait, but if each thread is responsible for a single element in a row, then for each row, there are N elements. But if the block size is small, say 256, then each block can process multiple rows. Wait, maybe not. Let's think about the grid and blocks.

The kernel needs to process all M rows. Each row has N elements. So the total number of elements is M*N. But the kernel is designed to process each element in parallel. However, since the sum is over the entire row, perhaps each thread can process a single element in a row and accumulate the sum. But how to do that.

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single row. Then, for each row, the thread would sum all the elements in that row. But that would require that each thread has access to all elements in the row. But for a row of N elements, that would require N memory accesses per thread, which could be inefficient. However, if the row is large, that's a problem. So maybe a better approach is to have each thread handle a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction across the elements in the row.

Wait, but in this case, the sum is over the entire row. So for each row, the sum is the sum of all elements in that row. So perhaps the kernel can be structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then the threads in the block perform a reduction to sum all the elements in the row. Then, the block's result is the sum for that row, and the final output is the sum of each row.

So, for example, each block is responsible for processing one row. Then, each thread in the block processes a single element in the row, and then the threads in the block reduce the sum. But how to structure this.

Alternatively, maybe each block is responsible for processing multiple rows. But that might complicate things. Let's think of the kernel as follows:

Each thread is responsible for a single element in the tensor. But that's not efficient for summing a row. Alternatively, each thread can be responsible for a single row, and then sum all elements in that row. But how to do that.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensor is [M, N]. So each row is contiguous in memory. So for row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j for j from 0 to N-1.

So, for each row i, the sum is sum_{j=0}^{N-1

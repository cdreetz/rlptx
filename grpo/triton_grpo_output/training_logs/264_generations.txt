Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think through the steps.

First, the problem is to compute C = A * B, where A is MxK and B is KxN. The result C should be MxN. So each element C[i,j] is the sum over k of A[i,k] * B[k,j].

In Triton, I need to structure the kernel to handle this efficiently. Let's recall how matrix multiplication is done in parallel. Each thread should handle a single element of the result matrix. But since K can be large, we need to optimize the inner loop.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is typically written with threads processing elements in a grid. So maybe I should structure the kernel so that each thread computes one element of C. However, for large K, this could be slow because each thread would have to perform K operations. So maybe we need to optimize by using block sizes that can process multiple elements at once.

Alternatively, maybe using a more efficient approach where each thread handles a block of elements. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton.

In the standard approach, each thread computes one element of the result matrix. So for each i and j, the thread computes the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. But with K being the dimension that's being summed over, this would require K operations per thread. If K is large, this could be slow. So maybe we need to find a way to process multiple elements in a single thread.

Alternatively, maybe using a block size that allows for more efficient memory access. For example, using a block size of 16, and each thread computes a block of elements. But I need to think about the memory layout.

The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. So for A, each row is contiguous in memory. Similarly for B. So for a given i and j, the elements A[i][k] and B[k][j] are located at positions i*K + k and k*N + j, respectively.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with threads, and each thread has a position in the grid. So for the kernel, the threads would be arranged in a grid that covers all possible i and j. But how to map the threads to i and j?

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured with a grid of threads where each thread is responsible for a particular (i, j) pair. So the kernel would have a grid of size (M, N), and each thread computes C[i][j].

But for each thread, the computation is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So the inner loop is over k from 0 to K-1. However, if K is large, this loop could be slow. So to optimize, perhaps we can use a block size that allows for more efficient memory access.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the inner dimension. So for each thread, the code would have to loop over k, multiply the elements, and accumulate the sum.

But how to structure this. Let me think about the code structure.

The kernel would have parameters for the input tensors A and B, and the output tensor C. The kernel would have to handle the indices i and j for the output matrix. Then, for each k in 0 to K-1, load A[i][k] and B[k][j], multiply, and add to C[i][j].

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the inner dimension. So the code would look something like:

@triton.jit
def kernel(...):
    i = ... # thread's i
    j = ... # thread's j
    total = 0
    for k in range(K):
        a = tl.load(A[i, k])
        b = tl.load(B[k, j])
        total += a * b
    tl.store(C[i, j], total)

But this would be very slow for large K. So maybe we need to optimize the inner loop by using a block size that allows for more efficient memory access.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured with a block size that allows each thread to process multiple elements. But that might complicate the code.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a more efficient approach by using a block size that allows for each thread to process a block of K elements. But that might not be straightforward.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that for each thread, the inner loop is over K elements, which is O(K) per thread. So for large K, this is not efficient. So maybe we need to find a way to process multiple elements in parallel.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a different approach where each thread computes multiple

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first matrix is MxK, the second is KxN, so the result should be MxN. Each element in the output is the sum of the products of elements from the rows of the first matrix and columns of the second matrix.

In Triton, I need to structure the kernel to handle this efficiently. Let me recall how Triton works. The kernel is divided into blocks, and each thread handles a block of elements. For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to compute a portion of the result.

I remember that for matrix multiplication, a common strategy is to have each thread compute a single element of the output matrix. But that might not be the most efficient. Alternatively, using a block size that allows each thread to compute multiple elements, but that depends on the problem.

Wait, for a standard approach, each thread computes a single element of the result. So for each element (i, j) in the output, the thread would compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. But with Triton, we need to handle this in a way that's efficient in terms of memory access and thread organization.

So the kernel will have to loop over the elements of the output matrix. Let's think about the indices. For each row i in the first matrix (M rows), and each column j in the second matrix (N columns), we need to compute the sum over k (from 0 to K-1) of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But how to structure this in Triton. The kernel will have to have a loop over the elements of the output. Let me think about the parameters. The input tensors are A (M, K) and B (K, N). The output is C (M, N).

In Triton, the kernel is written with a function that takes the input tensors and the output tensor. The kernel is divided into blocks, and each thread handles a block of elements. For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to compute a portion of the result.

But for the standard matrix multiplication, each thread computes a single element. So the kernel would have to iterate over i and j, and for each, compute the sum over k. However, that might not be efficient because of the memory access patterns.

Alternatively, using a more efficient approach where each thread computes a block of elements. But that's more complex. For simplicity, maybe start with the standard approach where each thread computes a single element.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. So for A, each row is contiguous in memory. Similarly for B. The output C is also stored in row-major order.

So for each element C[i][j], we need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

In Triton, the kernel will have to process this. Let me think about the parameters. The kernel will need to know the shapes of the tensors, and the strides. For example, for A, the stride along the K dimension is 1, and along the M dimension is K. Similarly for B, the stride along N is 1, and along K is N.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a function that takes the input tensors and the output tensor, and then the kernel is launched with the appropriate parameters.

So the kernel function would look something like this:

@triton.jit
def kernel(A, B, C, M, K, N):
    # compute the index i and j for the current element
    # then compute the sum over k

But how to structure the loops. For each element (i, j), the thread would compute the sum over k. However, in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. But for a matrix multiplication, the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element. However, this can be very slow because each thread has to loop over K elements. So for large K, this is not efficient.

Wait, but maybe the problem is that the user wants a standard Triton kernel for matrix multiplication. So perhaps the correct approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to compute multiple elements, but that's more complex. Alternatively, maybe the user wants a standard implementation, even if it's not the most optimized.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to implement a standard matrix multiplication using Triton, which is a common example. So I'll proceed with that.

Let me think about the steps again.

First, the kernel needs to process each element of the output matrix. For each i in 0

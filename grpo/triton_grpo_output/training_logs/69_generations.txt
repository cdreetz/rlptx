Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The user wants tile-based computation using shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in Triton.

First, the problem is to compute C = A * B, where A is MxK and B is KxN. The result C will be MxN. The key here is to use shared memory to optimize memory access, especially since matrix multiplication is memory-intensive.

In Triton, the kernel is written in a way that each thread handles a block of elements. For tile-based computation, I'll need to divide the matrices into tiles. The standard approach is to use a block size that's a multiple of the tile size, but since Triton's block size is fixed, I'll have to choose a block size that allows for efficient tiling.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. For matrix multiplication, each threadblock will compute a block of the output matrix. The shared memory will hold a tile of A and a tile of B. The size of the tile depends on the block size. Typically, the tile size is chosen as the block size, but maybe I need to adjust that.

Wait, in Triton, the block size is specified with the @triton.jit decorator. Let me choose a block size. For example, if I use a block size of 128, then each threadblock will handle a tile of size 128x128. But since the matrices are MxK and KxN, the tile size should be such that the tiles fit into the shared memory.

But maybe I should use a block size that allows for efficient computation. Let me recall that in standard matrix multiplication, each threadblock computes a portion of the output matrix. The number of threads per block is usually set to a multiple of the tile size. For example, if the tile size is 16x16, then the block size might be 16x16, but that's not possible in Triton since the block size is a single integer. Wait, no, in Triton, the block size is the number of threads per block, and each thread handles a certain number of elements.

Alternatively, the block size is the number of threads per block, and each thread is responsible for a small portion of the computation. For matrix multiplication, each thread might compute a single element of the output matrix. But that's not efficient. Instead, we use tiling, where each threadblock computes a block of the output matrix by loading tiles of A and B into shared memory, then performing the multiplication.

So the steps would be:

1. For each threadblock, compute a tile of the output matrix C.
2. Load a tile of A into shared memory.
3. Load a tile of B into shared memory.
4. Multiply the tiles and accumulate the result into C.

But how to structure this in Triton?

First, the kernel needs to handle the indices for A, B, and C. Each thread in the block will compute a certain element of the output matrix. However, with tiling, the threads will work on a tile of the output matrix, which requires that the threadblock is responsible for a certain range of rows and columns in C.

Alternatively, the threadblock is responsible for a block of rows in A and a block of columns in B. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the tile size. Let me assume that the tile size is T. Then, each threadblock will compute a block of T rows in A and T columns in B, resulting in a T x T block in C.

But the actual implementation would require that the threads in the block handle the elements of the tile. For example, each thread in the block would compute a single element of the tile. However, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, the threads can be arranged in a grid that allows for more efficient computation.

Alternatively, each threadblock computes a block of the output matrix. The number of threads per block is determined by the block size. For example, if the block size is 128, then each threadblock has 128 threads. These threads can be arranged in a 16x8 grid, for example. Each thread would compute a certain element of the output matrix.

But in matrix multiplication, each element of C is the sum of the products of elements from A's row and B's column. So, for a given element C[i][j], it's the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

To compute this efficiently, we need to load A's row i into shared memory, load B's column j into shared memory, then compute the sum. But that's not efficient for large K. Instead, we can tile the matrices into smaller blocks and compute the

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The user mentioned using tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through the steps.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The two input matrices are A (MxK) and B (KxN), and the result is C (MxN). Each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for k from 0 to K-1.

In Triton, I need to implement this efficiently using shared memory. The key is to tile the matrices into blocks so that each thread can compute a block of the result. The standard approach is to use a block size that allows for efficient memory access, like 32 or 64 elements per thread.

Let me consider the memory layout. The input matrices A and B should be stored in shared memory. Each thread will handle a block of size, say, 32x32. For each thread, we need to compute a portion of the result matrix C.

Wait, but for matrix multiplication, each thread typically handles one element of the result. However, with shared memory, we can load tiles of A and B into shared memory, then compute the dot product of the tiles. So, the block size would be determined by the number of elements per thread. For example, if each thread computes a block of size 32x32, then the number of threads per block would be 32x32, but that's probably too large. Alternatively, maybe the block size is 32, and each thread handles a certain number of elements.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to use a block size of 32, and each thread computes a portion of the result. Let me recall the standard Triton matrix multiplication kernel. In that case, each thread is responsible for computing one element of the result matrix. But with shared memory, we can load the relevant rows of A and columns of B into shared memory, then compute the dot product.

But for the given problem, the input matrices are A (MxK) and B (KxN). So, the result is C (MxN). So, each thread would compute one element of C. But for that, each thread needs to access a row of A and a column of B. However, with shared memory, we can load a block of A's rows and B's columns into shared memory, then compute the dot product.

Wait, but the tile-based approach would involve dividing the matrices into tiles. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread would handle a tile of size 32x32. But how does that fit into the matrix multiplication?

Alternatively, the standard approach is to use a block size of 32, and each thread computes a portion of the result. Let me think about the steps:

1. The kernel is launched with grid dimensions that cover all elements of the result matrix. Each thread is responsible for computing one element of C.

But with shared memory, we can load the relevant rows of A and columns of B into shared memory. For example, for a given thread, if it's computing C[i][j], then it needs to load the row i of A into shared memory, and the column j of B into shared memory. Then compute the dot product of these two vectors.

But that would require each thread to load a row of A and a column of B, which might be inefficient. Instead, a more efficient approach is to use tiles. For example, each thread block loads a tile of A and a tile of B into shared memory, then computes the dot product for each element of the result.

Wait, but the problem is that the matrices A and B are of sizes MxK and KxN. So, the number of rows in A is M, and the number of columns in B is N. The result matrix C has M rows and N columns.

So, for each element C[i][j], we need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. To do this efficiently, we can use shared memory to store a block of A's rows and B's columns.

But how to structure the threads. Let me think of the kernel as follows:

Each thread block is responsible for computing a block of the result matrix. Let's say that each thread block is responsible for a block of size (block_size, block_size) in the result matrix. Then, each thread in the block would compute one element of the result.

But for that, the threads would need to load a row of A and a column of B into shared memory. However, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, the threads could load a tile of A and a tile of B into shared memory, and compute the dot product for each element in the

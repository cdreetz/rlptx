Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the minimum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor). So for each row (each M element), I need to find the minimum among the N elements in that row.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Now, considering the memory layout. The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. For each row, the elements are stored consecutively. So for row i, the elements are at positions i*N to i*N + N-1.

For the kernel, I need to process each row. So the kernel should iterate over each row (M rows), and for each row, compute the minimum of the N elements.

Optimal block sizes and memory access patterns. Since each row is processed independently, I can structure the kernel to handle one row per block. But wait, Triton's blocks can be arranged in a way that each thread handles a single element. However, for efficiency, maybe each thread can handle a single element in the row, but that might not be optimal. Alternatively, using a warp-based approach where each thread processes a single element, but that's probably not the most efficient. Alternatively, using a block that processes a row, with each thread handling a single element in the row. But for a row of N elements, if N is large, maybe we can have multiple threads per row. However, since the kernel is for a 2D tensor, perhaps it's better to have each thread handle one element in the row, and then compute the minimum across all threads in the block.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, if each thread in the block processes one element, then the block can compute the minimum of all elements in the row. But how to do that? Let's think: each thread loads an element, then the threads compare their values and keep the minimum. But how to do that in Triton.

In Triton, each thread can be assigned to a specific element in the row. For example, for a row i, each thread in the block can be responsible for a single element. Then, the threads can compute the minimum among all elements in the row. However, for this, the block needs to have enough threads to cover all elements in the row. But if the row has N elements, and the block has, say, 128 threads, then for N larger than 128, we need to have multiple blocks processing the same row. Wait, but that's not efficient. Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed to process each row in a separate block, but that might not be possible because the kernel is launched with a grid that can be determined based on the number of rows.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread processes a single element in the row, and then the threads in the block compute the minimum. For example, for a row, each thread in the block handles one element, and then they compare their values to find the minimum. But this requires that the block has enough threads to cover all elements in the row. However, if the row has N elements, and the block has, say, 128 threads, then for N < 128, the threads can process all elements. For N larger than 128, this approach might not work. But perhaps the kernel is designed to handle each row in a way that each thread in the block handles a single element, and then the block computes the minimum of all elements in the row. However, this would require that the block has enough threads to cover all elements in the row, which may not be feasible if N is large. Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed to process each row in a way that the block processes the entire row, with each thread handling a single element, and then the block reduces the minimum across all elements in the row.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let's think about the kernel parameters. The kernel will take the input tensor, the output tensor, the dimensions M and N. Then, for each row i, the kernel processes the elements in that row.

So, the kernel should have a loop over the rows (i), and for each row, process the elements in that row. But how to structure this in Triton. Triton kernels are typically written with a grid and a block, and each thread is responsible for a specific element.

So, for each row i, the kernel will process the elements in that row. Let's think about the

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is to find the minimum value in each row of the tensor. Since it's a 2D tensor, each row is of length N. So for each row (i.e., each row index M), I need to find the minimum value among the N elements in that row.

Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for GPU parallelism. So I need to structure the kernel to process multiple elements in parallel, using shared memory if necessary, and ensuring efficient memory access patterns.

Let me outline the steps:

1. **Input and Output Shapes**: The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

2. **Memory Layout**: The input tensor is stored in row-major order. Each row is contiguous in memory. For each row, we need to process all N elements.

3. **Block Size and Threads per Block**: I need to decide on the block size. Since each row is processed independently, each thread can handle a single element in a row. But since there are N elements per row, and threads per block can be up to 1024, I need to determine how many threads per block to use. However, since each row is processed independently, maybe each thread can handle a single element in a row. Wait, but for a row of N elements, if each thread processes one element, then the number of threads per block would be N. But if N is large, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can process multiple elements per thread, but that depends on how we structure the kernel.

Wait, but for a reduction, the standard approach is to have each thread handle a portion of the data, and then combine results. However, in this case, since we need to find the minimum of a row, which is a reduction along the row. So for each row, we can have a reduction over the N elements.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let's think: For each row, we can have a group of threads that work on that row. Each thread would process a certain number of elements in the row, and then combine their results.

Alternatively, since each row is independent, maybe each thread can be assigned to a specific row and process all elements in that row. But that would require that each thread handles a row, and then reduces the elements in that row. However, if the number of rows is large, that might not be efficient. But given that the kernel is written for a 2D tensor, perhaps we can structure it such that each thread is responsible for a single row.

Wait, but the kernel is written for a 2D tensor. So perhaps the kernel is launched with a grid size that covers all rows, and each thread processes a single row. But how to handle the elements in that row?

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in a row, and then perform a reduction across all elements in the row. But that would require that each thread is part of a reduction group for that row.

But how to structure that. Let me think about the standard approach for a reduction in Triton.

In a typical 1D reduction, you have a grid of threads that each process a part of the data, and then combine their results. For example, for a 1D array, each thread is responsible for a subset of elements, and then they combine their results.

But in this case, the data is 2D, and the reduction is along the second dimension (the last dimension). So for each row, we need to reduce the N elements in that row.

So perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single row, and then processes the elements in that row to find the minimum.

But how to do that. Let's think about the kernel parameters. The kernel would take the input tensor, and the output tensor. The input is [M, N], output is [M].

So for each row i (from 0 to M-1), we need to find the minimum of the elements in input[i, 0...N-1].

In Triton, the kernel is written with a grid of threads, each thread handling a specific row. So the grid size would be M threads, each handling one row. Then, within each thread, we process the elements of that row.

But how to process the elements of the row. For each row, we need to iterate through all N elements and find the minimum.

But if each thread is responsible for a row, then for each row, the thread would need to process all N elements. However, that would be O(N) per thread, which

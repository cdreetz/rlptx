Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first tensor is A with shape (M, K), and the second is B with shape (K, N). The result should be a tensor C with shape (M, N), where each element C[i,j] is the sum of A[i,k] * B[k,j] for all k in 0 to K-1.

Now, considering how to implement this in Triton. Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for GPU parallelism. The key is to partition the computation into blocks that can be processed in parallel.

For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a tile-based approach. Each block (or thread group) handles a submatrix of A and B, and computes the corresponding part of C. The number of threads per block is usually determined by the block size, which is a parameter we can choose. Let's think about the block size. For example, if we use a block size of 128, that's a common choice for many GPU kernels.

But wait, in matrix multiplication, each thread typically handles one element of the result. However, with the tile approach, each thread might handle a small tile of the matrix. Alternatively, using a block size that allows for efficient memory access patterns.

Let me recall that in Triton, each thread is responsible for a certain part of the computation. For matrix multiplication, each thread can compute one element of the result. However, with large K, this might not be efficient. So perhaps using a block size that allows for multiple elements to be computed per thread, but that depends on the specific implementation.

Alternatively, using a block size that allows for a certain number of rows and columns to be processed. For example, if each block handles a certain number of rows in A and columns in B, but I think that's more for the case where the matrices are large and we're using a tile-based approach.

But for the standard matrix multiplication, each thread computes one element of the result. So for each element C[i,j], the thread would compute the sum over k of A[i,k] * B[k,j]. However, if K is large, this sum could take many cycles. To optimize, we can use a block size that allows for multiple elements to be computed in parallel.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written in a way that each thread is responsible for a certain part of the computation. So for matrix multiplication, the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element of the result. However, that would require K iterations per thread, which could be expensive if K is large. So to optimize, we can use a block size that allows for multiple elements to be computed in parallel.

Alternatively, using a block size that allows for a certain number of rows in A and columns in B. For example, each thread block processes a certain number of rows in A and columns in B, and computes the corresponding elements in C. But that's more of a tile-based approach.

But for the sake of simplicity, maybe the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element of C. Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. So for A, each row is contiguous in memory, and similarly for B.

In the kernel, each thread will have an index (i, j) for the result C. Then, for each k in 0 to K-1, it would load A[i][k] and B[k][j], multiply them, and accumulate the sum.

But if K is large, this would be slow. To optimize, we can use a block size that allows for multiple k's to be processed in parallel. However, in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. So perhaps the kernel is structured with a loop over the k's, and each thread computes one element of C.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. For example, the kernel would have a loop over the rows of A, and for each row, a loop over the columns of B, and then a loop over the K elements. But that would be too slow for large K.

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured to have each thread compute a single element of C, and for that element, loop over the K elements. However, this would be O(K) per element, which is not efficient.

So, perhaps the better approach is to use a block size that allows for multiple elements to be computed in parallel. For example, using a block size of 128, and each thread handles a certain number of elements. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to use a block size

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first matrix is MxK, the second is KxN, so the result should be MxN. Each element in the output is the sum of the product of elements from the first row and second column, for each k in 0 to K-1.

In Triton, I need to structure the kernel to handle this efficiently. The key is to use shared memory for the input tensors to reduce global memory access latency. Since each element in the output depends on K elements from the first matrix and K elements from the second matrix, I need to load these into shared memory.

Let me consider the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 is common. Let's go with 32 for now. Each thread in the block will handle a portion of the output matrix. But how to split the work?

Each thread will compute one element of the output matrix. So for each thread, we need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. But how to map the thread indices to i and j?

The threads should be organized in a way that each thread is responsible for a specific (i, j) pair. But since the matrices are of size MxK and KxN, the threads need to iterate over the K elements for each i and j.

Wait, maybe I should structure the kernel such that each thread block handles a row of the first matrix and a column of the second matrix. But how to split that into threads?

Alternatively, each thread block can handle a block of rows from the first matrix and a block of columns from the second matrix. But that's more complex. Maybe a simpler approach is to have each thread compute one element of the output, and use shared memory to load the necessary elements of A and B.

So, for each thread, the index in the output matrix is (i, j). The thread will compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. But to do this, the thread needs to load A[i][k] and B[k][j] for all k in 0 to K-1.

But if K is large, this could be slow. So, we need to use shared memory to store the A and B elements that the thread needs. Let's think about how to do that.

Each thread block will handle a certain number of rows from A and columns from B. Let's say each thread block handles a block of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) for the output. Wait, but the output is MxN. So, for each thread block, we need to process a certain number of rows and columns.

Alternatively, each thread block can process a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread block can handle 32 rows of A and 32 columns of B. But this depends on the actual matrix dimensions.

But maybe that's getting too complicated. Let's think of each thread as handling one element of the output matrix. For that, each thread needs to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. To do this efficiently, we can load the A[i][k] into shared memory for the current row i, and B[k][j] into shared memory for the current column j.

But how to structure the shared memory. Let me think: for each thread block, we can load a block of rows from A into shared memory. Then, for each thread in the block, we can load the corresponding elements from A and B.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread block process a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread block handles 32 rows of A and 32 columns of B. Then, each thread in the block computes the dot product between a row of A and a column of B.

But how to split the work. Let me think of the kernel as follows:

Each thread block is responsible for computing a submatrix of the output. The block size is determined by the number of rows and columns that can be processed by the block. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread block handles 32 rows of A and 32 columns of B. Then, each thread in the block computes the dot product between the row i of A and column j of B.

But for this, the threads need to be arranged in a grid where each thread block handles a block of rows and columns. The number of threads per block would be BLOCK_M x BLOCK_N, where

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is to sum over the columns (since the last dimension is N). So for each row in the tensor, we need to add up all the elements in that row. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding row.

Now, considering Triton kernels, I need to figure out how to structure the kernel. Triton is a high-performance GPU programming language, so I need to make sure that the kernel is optimized for memory access and parallelism.

Let me start by thinking about the input and output. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output is a 1D tensor of shape [M]. Each element in the output is the sum of the elements in the corresponding row of the input.

In Triton, the kernel will be launched with a certain number of blocks and threads per block. The key is to determine how to partition the rows into blocks. Since each row is processed independently, each block can handle a range of rows. But since the sum is over the columns, each thread in the block needs to process a column of the row.

Wait, but for a row, each thread could be responsible for a single element. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each thread can process a single element in the row, and then accumulate the sum. However, for a row with N elements, if each thread handles one element, then each block would need to process N elements. But that might not be efficient in terms of memory access patterns.

Alternatively, maybe we can process the row in a way that each thread handles a chunk of elements. But since the sum is over the entire row, perhaps the simplest way is to have each thread process one element and accumulate the sum. But that would require that each thread in the block handles one element in the row.

But how to structure the threads. Let's think about the grid and blocks. Let's say we have M rows. Each block can handle a certain number of rows. For example, if we have BLOCK_SIZE = 128, then each block can handle a certain number of rows. But since each row has N elements, and each thread in the block can process one element, then each block would have N elements to process. But that might not be efficient. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of how many threads per block.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread processes a single element in the row. For each row, the threads in the block process each element in the row. But that would require that each thread in the block is responsible for a single element in the row. However, for a row with N elements, the number of threads per block would be N. But that might not be efficient if N is large. However, since the kernel is written in Triton, which is designed for efficient parallelism, perhaps that's manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured to have each thread process a single element in the row, and then accumulate the sum. Let's think about the steps.

First, the kernel needs to process each row. So, for each row i, we need to sum all elements in that row. The kernel will be launched with a grid that has enough blocks to cover all rows. Each block will handle a certain number of rows. Wait, but if each block handles one row, then each block would have to process N elements. But that's not efficient. Because for each row, the number of threads per block would be N. But if N is large, that could be a problem. However, Triton allows for dynamic programming, so maybe that's manageable.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each block processes a range of rows. For example, if there are M rows, each block processes a certain number of rows. But since each row has N elements, each block would need to process N elements per row. But that's not feasible if the block size is fixed.

Wait, maybe I should think of the problem in terms of the grid and the threads. Let's consider that each thread in the kernel is responsible for a single element in the input tensor. Then, for each row, the sum is the sum of all elements in that row. So, for a given row i, the elements are at positions (i, 0), (i, 1), ..., (i, N-1). Each thread would process one of these elements, and then accumulate the sum.

But how to structure the threads. Let's think about the grid. The grid is determined by the number of rows. For example, if there are M rows, then the grid is of size M. Each block processes one row. Then, within

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum each column of the tensor. So for each column (which is along the N dimension), we need to add up all the elements in that column. The input is a 2D tensor with M rows and N columns. The output should be a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the sum of the corresponding column.

Next, input and output tensor shapes. The input is [M, N], and the output is [M]. The memory layout is probably row-major, but since we're dealing with a 2D tensor, each row is contiguous in memory. So for a given row i, the elements are at positions i*N to i*N + N-1.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels use warps and threads per warp. A common approach is to use a block size that's a multiple of 32, like 128 or 256. But for sum reduction, we need to process elements in a way that allows for efficient coalesced memory access. Since we're summing along the last dimension (columns), each thread should handle a specific column. Wait, but if each thread is responsible for a column, then each thread would need to read all elements in that column. But that might not be efficient because each thread would have to read M elements, which could be a lot. Alternatively, maybe we can process the columns in a way that each thread handles a range of elements in the column.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as each thread being responsible for a single column. For example, if there are N columns, each thread can handle one column. But then, for each column, the thread would need to read M elements. However, if the threads are arranged in a way that they can process multiple columns, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the threads are arranged in a way that each thread processes a certain number of elements in the column, but that might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, think of the problem as for each column, sum all elements in that column. So for each column j (from 0 to N-1), sum over i from 0 to M-1 of A[i][j]. The output is a vector of size M, where output[i] is the sum of column i.

So, for each thread, we can assign a column index. Then, for that column, we need to sum all the elements in that column. But how to do that efficiently in Triton?

Wait, but in Triton, each thread is a warp. Wait, no, in Triton, the kernel is divided into blocks, each block has a certain number of threads. So, for example, if we have a block size of 128, each block can process multiple columns. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps we can have each thread handle a single element in the column. But that would require that each thread is responsible for a particular (i,j) pair, but that's not helpful for summing.

Wait, maybe the approach is to have each thread process a certain number of elements in the column. For example, if the block size is 128, and each thread is responsible for a certain number of elements in the column. But how to split that.

Alternatively, since the sum is along the last dimension (columns), maybe we can process each column in a way that each thread is responsible for a single column. But then, for each column, the thread would need to read M elements. However, if the column is stored in a contiguous way, then for a given column j, the elements are at positions j, j + N, j + 2N, etc. Wait, no, if the tensor is stored in row-major order, then each row is contiguous. So for column j, the elements are at positions i*N + j for i from 0 to M-1. So for a given column j, the elements are spread out in memory, not contiguous. So if we have a thread that needs to read all elements in column j, it would have to access each element in sequence, which would be non-coalesced. That's not efficient.

Hmm, that's a problem. So if each thread is responsible for a column, then the memory access for that column would be non-coalesced, leading to poor performance. So maybe we need a different approach.

Alternative approach: For each thread, process a range of elements in the column. For example, if we have multiple threads per column, each thread can handle a subset of the elements in the column. But how to organize this.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a reduction pattern where each thread processes a certain number of elements

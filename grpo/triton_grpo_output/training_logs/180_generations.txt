Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The user mentioned using tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in Triton.

First, the problem is to compute C = A * B, where A is MxK and B is KxN. The result C will be MxN. Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. 

In Triton, I need to handle this efficiently using shared memory to reduce global memory access. The key is to tile the matrices into blocks that fit into shared memory. Let's think about the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 elements is common. Let me choose 32 as a block size for this example.

So, each thread will handle a block of size BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE. But wait, the matrices A and B have dimensions MxK and KxN. So, the tiles need to be arranged such that each thread can compute a part of the result.

For shared memory, I'll need to load chunks of A and B into shared memory. Let me think about the layout. For matrix A (MxK), each thread in the block will handle a row of A. Similarly, for matrix B (KxN), each thread in the block will handle a column of B. Wait, no. Actually, for matrix multiplication, each thread in the block will compute a portion of the result. 

Wait, maybe I should structure it as follows: Each thread block computes a block of the result matrix. For each block, the threads load a tile of A and a tile of B into shared memory. Then, each thread in the block computes a part of the result.

But how to split the matrices into tiles? Let's say the block size is 32. For matrix A (MxK), each tile is of size (BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE). But since K might not be a multiple of BLOCK_SIZE, we need to handle that. Similarly for B.

Wait, maybe the tile size for A is (BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE), and for B it's (BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE). But since A is MxK and B is KxN, the tiles would be (BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE) for A and (BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE) for B. But when multiplying, the tiles would be (BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE) for A and (BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE) for B, and their product would be (BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE) for the result.

Wait, no. The actual multiplication would involve multiplying a row of A (size BLOCK_SIZE) with a column of B (size BLOCK_SIZE), leading to a sum of BLOCK_SIZE elements. So, each thread in the block would compute one element of the result. But how many threads are in the block? For a block size of 32, maybe the block has 32x32 threads, but that's a lot. Alternatively, maybe the block size is 32, and each thread handles one element of the result. But that might not be efficient.

Alternatively, perhaps the block is divided into rows and columns. For example, each thread in the block handles a specific element of the result. But that might not be optimal. Let me think again.

In standard matrix multiplication, each thread block handles a portion of the result matrix. For example, if the result is MxN, each thread block could handle a block of size (BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE). But for that, the threads in the block would compute the elements in that block. However, for the matrix multiplication, the threads need to compute the dot product between a row of A and a column of B.

So, for each thread in the block, the thread would compute one element of the result. But that would require that the threads in the block are arranged in a way that each thread handles a different element. However, that might not be efficient because each thread would need to compute a dot product of BLOCK_SIZE elements. So, perhaps the block is divided into rows and columns, and each thread computes a part of the dot product.

Alternatively, the standard approach for Triton matrix multiplication is to have each thread compute a single element of the result by loading a row of A and a column of B into shared memory, then computing the dot product. But that would require that the threads are arranged in a way that each thread handles a different element.

But given that the user specified tile-based computation with shared memory, maybe the approach is to split the matrices into tiles of size (BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE), load them into shared memory, and then perform the multiplication.

Let me outline the steps:

1. The kernel is launched with grid dimensions that cover the entire MxN matrix

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The user wants tile-based computation using shared memory. Let me think through the steps.

First, the GPU operations. Matrix multiplication involves computing each element of the resulting matrix as the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix. Since we're using shared memory, I'll need to load tiles of the input matrices into shared memory to optimize memory access.

The input tensors are A (M,K) and B (K,N). The output is C (M,N). Each element C[i,j] is the sum over k of A[i,k] * B[k,j]. But with tile-based computation, I'll split the matrices into blocks. Let's decide on the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 is common. Let's go with 32 for this example, but maybe 128 if it's more efficient. Wait, the user didn't specify, so I should choose a reasonable block size. Let me think: if the block size is 16, then each thread handles a 16x16 tile. But maybe 32 is better for better memory coalescing. Let me check. For a 32x32 block, each thread would handle a 32x32 tile. Wait, no, in matrix multiplication, each thread usually handles a single element. But with tile-based, maybe each thread block processes a tile of A and B.

Wait, maybe I should structure the kernel such that each thread block processes a tile of A and B. So, for example, if the block size is 32, then each thread block handles a 32x32 tile of A and B. But I need to make sure that the shared memory is used properly.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the block size. Let's say each thread block handles a tile of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). So, for matrix A (M,K), each tile is of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), and similarly for B (K,N). But the actual tile size depends on how we split the matrices. Alternatively, the block size could be the number of elements each thread handles in a row or column.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of how the threads are arranged. For each thread, it's responsible for computing a single element of the output matrix. But with tile-based computation, we can split the matrices into tiles and compute them in blocks.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread block processes a tile of A and a tile of B, and computes the corresponding part of C. But that might be more complex. Alternatively, the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element of C, but with shared memory to store tiles of A and B.

Wait, the standard approach for Triton matrix multiplication is to have each thread compute a single element of C, but with shared memory to store tiles of A and B. Let me recall: for each thread, it's responsible for computing C[i,j] by loading A[i,k] and B[k,j] for all k, but that would be inefficient. Instead, we split the matrices into tiles. For example, each thread block processes a tile of A (of size BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE) and a tile of B (of size BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE), and computes the product. But this might be more efficient.

Alternatively, for each thread, it's responsible for computing a single element of C, but using shared memory to store a tile of A and a tile of B. Let me think again.

In the standard Triton matrix multiplication kernel, each thread block processes a tile of A and a tile of B. The threads in the block are arranged in a grid that covers the tile. For example, if the block size is 32x32, then each thread block processes a 32x32 tile of A and a 32x32 tile of B. Then, the threads in the block compute the product of these tiles. However, this approach may not be straightforward for all cases, especially when the matrix dimensions are not multiples of the block size.

But the user is asking for tile-based computation with shared memory. So perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread block handles a tile of A and a tile of B, and computes the corresponding part of C. However, the exact implementation depends on the block size and how the threads are arranged.

Alternatively, the kernel could be structured with each thread handling a single element of C, but using shared memory to store a tile of A and a tile of B. Let me think about that.

Let me outline the steps:

- The kernel is designed for matrix multiplication of A (M,K) and B (K,N), resulting in C

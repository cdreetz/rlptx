Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum over the N dimension, so each row in the MxN matrix should be summed. So for each row, we need to add up all the elements in that row.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding row.

Now, memory layout. The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. For a 2D tensor, the elements are stored as [0, 1, 2, ..., N-1] for the first row, then [N, N+1, ..., 2N-1] for the second row, etc. So for a given row i, the starting index is i * N.

Block size and memory access. Since we're processing rows, each thread can handle a single row. But wait, maybe it's better to have each thread handle a single element in the row. Wait, but if we have multiple threads per block, maybe we can process multiple elements per thread. However, for sum reduction, each thread would need to accumulate the sum for its assigned elements. But since we're summing over the entire row, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, we can have each thread handle a chunk of elements in the row, but that depends on the block size.

Wait, the standard approach for sum reduction in Triton is to have each thread process a single element, and then perform a reduction across threads in the block. But for a 2D tensor, if we're summing along the last dimension, each row is processed independently. So maybe each threadblock processes a single row, and each thread in the block handles a single element in that row. Then, the threads in the block sum their elements and accumulate into the output.

But how to structure this. Let me think. For each row i, we need to sum all N elements. Let's say each threadblock handles one row. So the number of threadblocks would be M. Each threadblock has multiple threads, each handling a single element in the row. Then, the threads in the block sum their elements and accumulate into the output.

Wait, but that might not be efficient. Because if N is large, and each threadblock has, say, 1024 threads, then each thread would process one element, but that would require 1024 threads per row. However, if the row has N elements, then for N elements, the number of threads per row would be N. But if N is large, that's not feasible. So maybe we need to process multiple elements per thread.

Alternatively, perhaps the block size is set to process multiple elements per thread. For example, each threadblock processes a single row, and each thread in the block is responsible for a range of elements in the row. But how to split that.

Alternatively, since the row is contiguous in memory, we can have each threadblock process a single row, and each thread in the block processes a single element in the row. Then, the threads in the block sum their elements and accumulate into the output. However, for that, the number of threads per block would be N, which could be large. But Triton allows for dynamic thread counts.

Wait, but the number of threads per block is limited by the maximum number of threads per block, which is typically 1024. So if N is larger than 1024, then we need to have multiple threads per block processing multiple elements. But maybe that's not the case here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps each threadblock handles a single row, and each thread in the block is responsible for a single element in the row. Then, the threads in the block sum their elements and accumulate into the output. But for that, the number of threads per block would be N. However, if N is larger than 1024, that's not possible. So perhaps the block size is set to 1024, and each threadblock processes a single row, but each thread in the block processes a single element. However, if N is larger than 1024, then the threads in the block would need to process multiple elements. Wait, but that's not possible. So maybe the approach is to have each threadblock process a single row, and each thread in the block processes a single element, but for rows where N is larger than the number of threads in the block, we need to have multiple threadblocks per row. But that's

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is to sum each column of the tensor. Since it's a 2D tensor, each column is a vector of length M. So for each column in the tensor, we need to sum all the elements in that column.

Triton kernels work with threads in blocks. So I need to figure out how to partition the work across the threads. Since we're summing along the last dimension (columns), each thread should handle a single element in a column. But wait, maybe it's better to have each thread handle a single column. Wait, no. Wait, the last dimension is N, so each column is along the N dimension. Wait, the tensor is [M, N], so the last dimension is N. So for each column (each index in the N dimension), we need to sum all M elements in that column.

So, for example, if the tensor is of shape [4, 3], then there are 3 columns. Each column has 4 elements. The sum for each column would be the sum of those 4 elements.

So the kernel needs to process each column, and sum all elements in that column.

Now, how to structure the kernel. Let's think about the threads. Each thread can handle one element in the tensor. But since we need to sum along the columns, maybe each thread can be responsible for a single column. Wait, but that would require that each thread processes all elements in a column. But that's not efficient, because each thread would have to process M elements. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread process a single element, and then accumulate the sum for each column.

Wait, but how to organize that. Let's think about the memory layout. The tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is stored contiguously. So for a tensor of shape [M, N], each row is M elements, and there are N rows. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the tensor is [M, N], so it's M rows and N columns. So each row is of length N. So the tensor is stored as M rows, each with N elements. So the element at (i, j) is at position i*N + j in the tensor. Wait, no, that's if it's stored in row-major order. So for a 2D tensor, the element (i, j) is at index i * N + j. So for each column j, the elements are (0,j), (1,j), ..., (M-1,j). So to sum column j, we need to sum all elements (i, j) for i from 0 to M-1.

So, the kernel needs to process each column j, and sum all elements in that column.

So, the approach is: for each column j, sum all elements in that column.

Now, how to structure the threads. Let's think about the grid and blocks. The kernel will have a grid of blocks, each block processing a column. Wait, but how to divide the columns among the blocks. Let's say each block is responsible for a single column. Then, each block would have to process all M elements in that column. But that would require that each block has M elements to process, which might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the column, and then they accumulate the sum for their column.

But how to do that. Let's think about the thread index. For each thread, we can assign them to a column. Let's say that the number of threads per block is such that each thread handles one element in a column. Wait, but that's not possible unless we have a way to map threads to columns and elements.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the tensor. Then, for each column, all the threads that are processing that column would contribute their element to the sum. But that would require that each thread knows which column they are in, and then the sum is accumulated per column.

But how to do that. Let's think about the steps:

1. The kernel is launched with a grid that has N blocks (since there are N columns). Each block is responsible for one column.

2. Within each block, the threads process the elements in that column. For example, if there are BLOCK_SIZE threads per block, then each thread would process one element in the column. But since the column has M elements, we need to have enough threads per block to process all elements. Wait, but that would require that the number of threads per block is at least M. But that's not feasible, since the number of threads per block is usually a fixed value (like 128,

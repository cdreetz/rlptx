Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first matrix is M x K, the second is K x N. The result should be M x N. So each element in the output is the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second.

In Triton, I need to structure the kernel to handle this efficiently. The key is to use shared memory for the tiles of the input matrices to reduce global memory access latency. The tile size is important here. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a common tile size is 128 elements, but I need to choose a block size that fits well with the hardware. Let's say a block size of 32 elements per thread, but I need to check if that's optimal.

Wait, the block size in Triton is usually chosen based on the number of elements each thread can process. For matrix multiplication, each thread might handle a block of elements. But the exact block size depends on the matrix dimensions. Let me think about how the threads are arranged.

In matrix multiplication, each thread can be responsible for computing a single element of the output matrix. But that's not efficient because it would require many global memory accesses. Instead, we use tile-based computation where each thread block processes a tile of the matrices.

Wait, maybe I should structure the kernel such that each thread block handles a block of the output matrix. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, each thread could handle a small tile of the input matrices. Let me recall the standard approach.

In the standard approach, the kernel is structured such that each thread block processes a tile of the output matrix. The input matrices are split into tiles, and each thread block computes a tile of the output. The shared memory is used to store these tiles. The threads within the block compute the dot product of the corresponding rows and columns.

But for this problem, the input matrices are [M, K] and [K, N]. Let's assume that M and K are large, and we need to process them in tiles. The shared memory will store the tiles of the first matrix (A) and the second matrix (B). Each thread in the block will compute a part of the output matrix.

Wait, perhaps each thread block is responsible for computing a block of the output matrix. For example, if the output is M x N, then each thread block computes a block of size (block_dim) x (block_dim), where block_dim is the tile size. But I need to make sure that the tile size is chosen such that the shared memory can hold the tiles.

Alternatively, each thread in the block computes a single element of the output matrix. But that would be inefficient. So, the tile-based approach is better.

Let me think about the shared memory. For the first matrix A (M x K), each tile is of size (tile_size x tile_size). Similarly for B (K x N). The shared memory will store these tiles. The threads in the block will compute the dot product of the corresponding rows and columns.

Wait, perhaps the threads are arranged such that each thread computes a single element of the output matrix. But to do that, each thread would need to access elements from A and B. However, this would require many global memory accesses, which is slow. So, the tile-based approach is better.

Let me think of the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton. The kernel is structured with a loop over the output matrix elements. Each thread computes one element. But to optimize, we use shared memory to cache the tiles of A and B.

Wait, maybe the kernel is structured as follows:

- Each thread block is responsible for a block of the output matrix. The block size is determined by the tile size. For example, if the tile size is 16, then each thread block handles a 16x16 block of the output matrix.

But how does that fit with the input matrices? The input matrices are M x K and K x N. The output is M x N. So, each thread block would process a block of the output matrix, which is of size (block_dim) x (block_dim). The corresponding tiles of A and B would be of size (block_dim) x (block_dim) and (block_dim) x (block_dim), but that may not fit.

Alternatively, the input matrices are split into tiles of size (tile_size x tile_size), and each thread block computes the product of these tiles. The threads in the block compute the dot product between the rows of A's tile and the columns of B's tile.

But I need to think about the exact structure. Let me look up the standard Triton matrix multiplication kernel.

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The user specified using tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through how to approach this.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The two input matrices are A (MxK) and B (KxN), and the output is C (MxN). Each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k in 0 to K-1.

But since we're using Triton, which is a GPU programming language, I need to think about how to efficiently compute this using shared memory and tile-based computation. Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for GPU execution, so I need to make sure that the kernel is efficient in terms of memory access and computation.

Tile-based computation usually involves breaking the matrices into smaller tiles that fit into shared memory. The idea is to load a tile of A and a tile of B into shared memory, compute the product, and then write the results back to global memory. This reduces the number of global memory accesses, which is important for performance.

So, the steps would be:

1. Determine the tile size. Let's say each tile is of size TILE_M x TILE_K for matrix A and TILE_K x TILE_N for matrix B. But since the tiles need to be compatible, maybe the tile size for A and B should be chosen such that they can be loaded into shared memory. The shared memory size is limited, so the tile size needs to be chosen appropriately.

Wait, the shared memory is limited. For example, if each tile is of size TILE_M x TILE_K, then the total size for A's tile would be TILE_M * TILE_K. Similarly for B's tile. The sum of these two should be less than the available shared memory. But the exact value depends on the specific GPU, but for the purposes of this problem, I'll need to choose a reasonable TILE_SIZE, perhaps 32 or 64.

But the user didn't specify the exact tile size, so I need to choose a standard value. Let's say TILE_M = 32, TILE_K = 32. Then each tile of A is 32x32, and each tile of B is 32x32. But for the matrix multiplication, the tiles need to be aligned in such a way that the computation can proceed.

Wait, the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to use a block size that allows for efficient computation. For example, each block (thread group) computes a block of the output matrix. The threads within the block process different elements of the matrix.

But in this case, since we're using shared memory, the approach is to load a tile of A and a tile of B into shared memory, compute the product, and then write the result to the output matrix.

So, for the kernel, the plan is:

- Each thread block handles a portion of the output matrix C. The block is responsible for computing a submatrix of C.

- For each thread in the block, it computes a single element of C. But this is not efficient. Instead, the threads should work in a way that computes the entire tile of C using the shared memory tiles of A and B.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to use a block size that can compute a tile of C. For example, each block computes a tile of C of size TILE_M x TILE_N. The threads in the block are responsible for computing different elements of this tile.

But in this case, the problem is that the matrices A and B are of size MxK and KxN. So, for each tile of A (size TILE_M x TILE_K) and tile of B (size TILE_K x TILE_N), the product would be a TILE_M x TILE_N tile of C. So, each block would compute a TILE_M x TILE_N tile of C.

But the problem is that the tiles of A and B may not be aligned with the block's computation. So, the kernel needs to handle the tiling of A and B.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to have each thread compute a single element of C, but with shared memory to store the tiles of A and B. However, this would require that each thread loads the necessary elements from A and B into shared memory, which could be inefficient.

Wait, but in the standard matrix multiplication Triton kernel, each thread is responsible for computing a single element of C. However, that's not efficient because it leads to a lot of memory accesses. So, the tile-based approach is better.

So, the key is to use shared memory to store tiles of A and B, and compute the product in a way that minimizes memory accesses.

Let me think about the steps again.

The kernel will process a block of threads. Each thread block

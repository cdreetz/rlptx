Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works. The result should be a tensor of shape [M, N], where each element is the dot product of the corresponding row from the first matrix and column from the second matrix.

First, I should think about the GPU operations required. Triton is a GPU programming language, so I need to use its primitives. The key steps are:

1. Iterate over the elements of the first matrix (A) and the second matrix (B).
2. For each element in the resulting matrix (C), compute the sum of the products of elements from A's row and B's column.
3. Accumulate the sum into the corresponding position in the result matrix.

Now, considering the input and output tensors. The first matrix A has dimensions M x K, and the second matrix B is K x N. The output matrix C will be M x N. So, for each element C[i, j], it's the sum over k from 0 to K-1 of A[i, k] * B[k, j].

Next, I need to determine the optimal block sizes and memory access patterns. Triton uses a grid-stride loop approach. For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to handle a portion of the computation. Typically, a block size of 128 or 256 is used, but I need to check what's optimal here.

The memory layout is important. The matrices are stored in row-major order, which is the default in most frameworks. So, for A, each row is contiguous in memory, and similarly for B. For the result matrix C, each row is contiguous.

Now, for the kernel, I need to define the parameters. The kernel will take the input tensors A and B, and the output tensor C. The kernel will be launched with the appropriate grid and block dimensions. The grid size would be (M, N) if using a single block, but that's not efficient. Instead, using a 2D grid where each block handles a portion of the rows and columns.

Wait, in Triton, the kernel is typically written with a single thread per block, but for matrix multiplication, it's more efficient to have each thread handle a specific element of the result matrix. However, that's not efficient for large K. So, perhaps using a block size that allows multiple elements to be processed in parallel.

Alternatively, using a block size that allows each thread to compute a part of the sum. For example, each thread could compute a certain number of elements in the sum, but that might not be straightforward.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the standard matrix multiplication approach. Each thread computes a single element of C. But that would require K operations per element, which could be slow if K is large. So, to optimize, we can use a block size that allows each thread to compute multiple elements of the sum. However, this is more complex.

Alternatively, using a block size that allows each thread to compute a part of the sum. For example, if the block size is 128, each thread can compute a certain number of elements in the sum. But this requires careful handling of the indices.

Alternatively, using a 2D grid where each block handles a portion of the rows and columns. For example, each block handles a block of rows and columns, and each thread within the block handles a specific element of the sum. But this is more complex.

Alternatively, using a 1D grid where each thread handles a specific element of the result matrix. For each element C[i, j], the thread would iterate over k from 0 to K-1, multiply A[i, k] and B[k, j], and accumulate the sum. However, this would be O(K) per element, which is not efficient for large K.

But given that Triton is designed for high-performance, perhaps we can optimize by using a block size that allows each thread to compute multiple elements of the sum. For example, if K is large, but the block size is set to process multiple k's per thread.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to compute a part of the sum. For example, if the block size is 128, each thread can compute a certain number of elements in the sum. But how to structure that?

Alternatively, using a 2D grid where each block handles a portion of the rows and columns. For example, each block handles a block of rows and columns, and each thread within the block handles a specific element of the sum. However, this requires that the block size is chosen such that the block can handle the necessary computations.

Alternatively, using a 1D grid where each thread handles a single element of the result matrix. For each element

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first matrix is MxK, the second is KxN, so the result should be MxN. Each element in the output is the sum of the products of elements from the rows of the first matrix and columns of the second matrix.

In Triton, I need to handle this with a kernel that can efficiently compute the dot product for each element. The key is to structure the kernel so that it's efficient in terms of memory access and parallelism.

Let me recall how Triton works. The kernel is written in a way that uses threads to process elements. Each thread can handle a specific element in the output matrix. But since matrix multiplication is computationally intensive, we need to optimize the memory access patterns.

So, for each element (i, j) in the output matrix, we need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. But in Triton, we can't directly loop over k for each thread. Instead, we need to structure the kernel to compute this sum efficiently.

I remember that in Triton, you can use a block size that allows for efficient computation. For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that can handle multiple elements in the inner loop. For example, using a block size of 128 or 256, which allows for efficient memory access.

But how to structure the threads? Each thread can be responsible for a particular element in the output matrix. However, since the inner loop (over k) is expensive, we need to find a way to compute it efficiently.

Wait, maybe the kernel should be structured such that each thread computes a certain number of elements in the inner loop. But that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, we can use a block size that allows for multiple k values to be processed in parallel.

Another approach is to use a grid of threads where each thread handles a specific (i, j) pair. But for each (i, j), we need to compute the sum over k. However, this would require each thread to loop over k, which could be slow if K is large.

But in Triton, the kernel is written in a way that the inner loop is handled by the hardware. So perhaps the kernel should be structured to compute the sum over k for each (i, j) pair. However, with large K, this could be slow. Therefore, we need to optimize the inner loop.

Wait, maybe the kernel can be designed with a block size that allows for multiple k values to be processed in parallel. For example, using a block size of 128, each thread can handle a certain number of k values. But I need to think about how to structure the memory access.

Let me think about the memory layout. The first matrix A is of shape [M, K], and the second matrix B is [K, N]. The output matrix C is [M, N]. So, each thread will compute C[i][j] as the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But in Triton, each thread is assigned a unique (i, j) pair. However, for each (i, j), the thread needs to loop over k. But if K is large, this could be slow. So, perhaps we can use a block size that allows for multiple k values to be processed in parallel.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel can be structured with a block size that allows each thread to process a certain number of k values. For example, if the block size is 128, each thread can process 128 k values, but that would require that the k indices are aligned in a way that allows for efficient memory access.

Wait, but in matrix multiplication, the standard approach is to have each thread compute a certain number of elements in the inner loop. However, the standard approach for Triton matrix multiplication is to use a block size that allows for efficient memory access by loading the elements into registers and then performing the computation.

Another thing to consider is the memory access patterns. For matrix multiplication, the key is to load the elements of A and B in a way that allows for coalesced memory access. So, for each thread, we need to load the row of A and the column of B, then compute the dot product.

But in Triton, each thread is responsible for a specific (i, j) pair. So, for each (i, j), the thread will need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But how to structure this in Triton. The standard approach is to use a block size that allows for multiple k values to be processed in parallel. However, in this case, since

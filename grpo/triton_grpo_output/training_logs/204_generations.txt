Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by breaking down the problem.

First, matrix multiplication involves computing C = A * B, where A is MxK and B is KxN. The result C will be MxN. Each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for k from 0 to K-1.

In Triton, I need to implement this using shared memory to reduce memory latency. The standard approach is to tile the matrices into blocks, load them into shared memory, compute the dot product, and then store the result.

So, the steps would be:

1. Determine the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 is used. Let's choose 32 for this example.

2. For each block of A and B, load them into shared memory. The shared memory will be used to store a tile of A and a tile of B. The tiles are of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), but since A is MxK and B is KxN, the tiles need to fit into the shared memory.

Wait, the tile size should be such that each tile of A is (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), and each tile of B is (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). But since A has dimensions MxK and B is KxN, the tiles would be (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) for A and (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) for B. However, the actual dimensions might need to be adjusted based on the problem.

But maybe I should think in terms of how many tiles fit into the matrix. For example, for matrix A (M x K), the number of tiles along the rows would be ceil(M / BLOCK_SIZE), and similarly for columns. But in the kernel, each threadblock will handle a block of A and a block of B.

Wait, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each threadblock handles a block of A and a block of B. The shared memory will store a block of A (size BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE) and a block of B (size BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE). Then, for each element in the resulting matrix C, we compute the dot product of the corresponding rows of A and columns of B.

But the actual dimensions might need to be adjusted. Let's think about the parameters. The kernel will process a block of A and a block of B. For each thread in the threadblock, it will compute one element of C. Wait, no. In standard matrix multiplication, each threadblock handles a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. But with shared memory, the approach is to tile the matrices into blocks, load them into shared memory, and compute the dot product.

Alternatively, the kernel could be structured such that each threadblock handles a block of A and a block of B, and the threads within the block compute the dot product for the corresponding elements in C.

But maybe I should look up the standard Triton matrix multiplication kernel structure. From what I remember, the standard approach is to have each threadblock compute a block of the result matrix. For each thread in the threadblock, it computes one element of the result. However, with shared memory, the threads load the corresponding tiles of A and B into shared memory, then compute the dot product.

Wait, perhaps the kernel is structured as follows:

Each threadblock is responsible for computing a block of the result matrix. For example, if the result matrix is MxN, then each threadblock handles a block of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) in the result. But that might not be the case. Alternatively, the threadblock handles a block of A (rows) and a block of B (columns), and the threads compute the dot product between them.

Alternatively, the kernel is designed such that each threadblock handles a block of A (rows) and a block of B (columns), and the threads within the block compute the dot product for the corresponding elements in the result.

But perhaps the standard approach is to use a block size of 32, and each threadblock handles a block of A (rows) and a block of B (columns), and the threads compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B.

But I need to make sure that the shared memory is used correctly. The shared memory will store a tile of A and a tile of B. The tile size is (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). So, for each threadblock, we load a tile of A (size BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE) and a tile of B (size BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE). Then, for each element in the result matrix, we compute the sum of the products of the corresponding elements in the tiles.

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in Triton.

First, the input tensors are A (M x K) and B (K x N). The result is C (M x N), where each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k. But doing this naively would be too slow, so we need to use shared memory and tiling.

In Triton, I'll need to use shared memory to store tiles of the input matrices. The idea is to split the matrices into smaller blocks (tiles) that fit into shared memory. For each tile, we compute the dot product between the corresponding rows of A and columns of B.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. For shared memory, I'll need to load chunks of A and B into shared memory. Each thread will handle a small block of the matrix.

The block size is important. Let's choose a block size that fits into shared memory. For example, if each thread handles a tile of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K) for A and (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N) for B, but I need to make sure that the tiles are small enough to fit into shared memory. Let's say BLOCK_M and BLOCK_K are 128, and BLOCK_N is 256. But I need to adjust based on the available shared memory.

Wait, the shared memory size is limited. For example, if each thread needs to store a block of size (BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K) for A and (BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N) for B, then the total shared memory required would be (BLOCK_M * BLOCK_K + BLOCK_K * BLOCK_N) * 1 (since each thread has its own copy). But maybe I should use smaller blocks to fit into shared memory.

Alternatively, the standard approach is to use a block size of 128 for both M and K, and 256 for N. Let me check the standard matrix multiplication in Triton. Typically, the block size is chosen as 128 for M and K, and 256 for N. But I need to make sure that the tiles fit into shared memory.

So, for each thread, I'll compute a portion of the matrix C. The threads are grouped into warps, and each warp handles a block of the matrix.

Let me outline the steps:

1. For each tile of A and B, load them into shared memory.
2. Compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B.
3. Store the result in C.

But how to handle the indices? Each thread will have a position in the tile. For example, the thread index in the block can be (i, j), where i is the row in the tile of A, and j is the column in the tile of B. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the block dimensions.

The kernel should be written with parameters for the matrix dimensions, and the block size. The kernel will iterate over the tiles of A and B, and compute the corresponding part of C.

Let me think about the parameters. The kernel will have parameters for M, K, N, and the input tensors A and B, and the output tensor C. But in Triton, the kernel is called with the parameters, and the kernel code will handle the computation.

The kernel will be structured as follows:

- For each tile of A and B:
   - Load the tile into shared memory.
   - Compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B.
   - Store the result in C.

But how to split the matrices into tiles. Let's assume that the block size is (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K) for A and (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N) for B. Wait, maybe the block size for the threads is (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K) for A and (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N) for B. But that might not be the right way.

Alternatively, the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element of C. But that's not efficient. Instead, using tile-based computation, each thread block computes a tile of C.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread block compute a tile of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N) in C. For that, the threads are arranged in a grid that covers the entire matrix. Each thread block processes a tile of C, and for each tile, it computes the dot product between the corresponding rows of A and columns of B.

So, for each tile of A (size BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K) and B (size BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N), the threads in the block compute the dot product between the

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the maximum value). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the max of N elements.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the maximum of the corresponding row.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Since we're processing each row, I should consider how to partition the rows into blocks. Let's say each block handles a certain number of rows. But since each row has N elements, the block size should be chosen such that each thread can process a portion of the row. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of threads per row. For each row, we can have multiple threads working on it. But since the maximum is a reduction, each thread would need to compare values and propagate the maximum.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to have each thread handle a single element in the row, but then how do we reduce them? Alternatively, we can use a parallel reduction within each row. For each row, we can have multiple threads that compute the max. But how to structure this in Triton.

Triton kernels typically work with a grid of threads, each handling a portion of the data. For this problem, each row is independent, so we can process each row in parallel. Let's think about the grid and blocks. Let's say each block handles a single row. But if the number of rows is large, this might not be efficient. Alternatively, we can have each block process multiple rows, but that might complicate things. Maybe it's better to have each thread process a single element in a row, and then perform a reduction across the elements in the row.

Wait, but the problem is that for each row, we need to compute the max of N elements. So for each row, we can have a reduction over the N elements. So the kernel should process each row, and for each row, perform a reduction over the N elements.

So the approach would be:

- For each row (i), process all elements in that row (from column 0 to N-1).
- For each row, perform a parallel reduction to find the maximum.

In Triton, how to structure this? Let's think about the grid and blocks. Let's say each block handles one row. Then, for each row, we can have multiple threads working on the elements of that row. But how to structure that.

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then they perform a reduction. But that's similar to a standard reduction.

But for a 2D tensor, each row is of length N. So for each row, we need to compute the max of N elements. So for each row, we can have a reduction over the N elements.

So the kernel would have a grid of threads, each handling a row. Then, within each row, the threads perform a reduction. But how to structure the threads per row.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then the threads in the block perform a reduction. But this would require that each block processes a single row, and the threads in the block work on the elements of that row.

Let me think about the parameters. The input tensor is [M, N]. The output is [M]. So for each row i, we need to compute the max of input[i, 0...N-1].

So the kernel should have a loop over the rows. For each row, we need to compute the max of the elements in that row.

In Triton, the kernel is written with a grid and a block. Let's say that each block handles one row. Then, the grid size is M. For each row, the block processes the elements of that row.

But how to structure the threads in the block. For each row, the number of elements is N. So for each row, the block can have multiple threads that process the elements of that row.

But in Triton, the block is a group of threads. So for each row, the block can be divided into threads that process the elements of the row. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block can process 128 elements of the row. But since N can be up to a large number, we need to handle that.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, the number of threads per block would be the number of elements in the row that the block can process

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations required. The task is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the maximum value). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the max of N elements.

Next, input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the max of the corresponding row.

Memory layout: The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. The output tensor will be a 1D array where each element corresponds to a row's maximum.

Optimal block sizes and memory access patterns. Since we're processing each row, we can consider each row as a separate workgroup. But Triton's parallelism is per thread, so maybe we can process each row with a thread block. However, since each row has N elements, and we need to process all elements in a row, the block size should be chosen such that each thread handles a portion of the elements in the row. But since the max reduction is a common operation, perhaps using a block size that can handle the entire row's elements, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, using a block size that allows each thread to process a segment of the row, but with proper synchronization.

Wait, for max reduction, a common approach is to have each thread process a portion of the data, and then combine results. But since each row is independent, maybe we can process each row in a separate block. But in Triton, the kernel is launched with a certain number of threads per block, and each thread is assigned a position in the grid. So perhaps we can have each thread handle a single element in the row, but that would require a lot of threads. Alternatively, using a block size that can process multiple elements in parallel, but with proper synchronization.

Alternatively, for each row, we can have a thread block that processes all elements in that row. But since the rows are independent, maybe we can process each row in a separate block. However, the kernel is launched with a grid size that's determined by the number of rows. So for each row, we can have a block of threads that process that row.

But how to structure the kernel. Let me think: the kernel will have a grid of threads, each thread is responsible for processing a single element in the row. But that would be inefficient. Alternatively, using a block size that allows for parallel processing of elements in the row. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block can process 128 elements in a row. But since the row has N elements, we need to make sure that the block size divides N or not, but that's not necessary. So each thread in the block would process a portion of the row, and then combine the max.

But for max reduction, a common approach is to have each thread process a chunk of the data, and then combine the results. For example, in a reduction, you can have each thread handle a portion of the data, and then perform a reduction across the threads. But in this case, since each row is independent, perhaps we can process each row in a separate block, and within each block, perform a reduction across the elements of the row.

Wait, but the kernel is written in Triton, which is a GPU programming language. So the kernel will be launched with a grid that has M blocks (one per row), and each block will process the elements of that row. So each block will have a certain number of threads, and each thread will process a portion of the row's elements.

But how to structure the threads. Let's think: for a given row, we have N elements. The number of threads per block should be such that each thread can process a portion of the elements. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block can process up to 128 elements. But since N can be any number, we need to handle that. However, in Triton, the kernel is written with a grid of threads, and each thread is assigned a position in the grid. So perhaps the kernel is structured such that for each row, we have a block of threads that process that row's elements.

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured with each thread handling a single element in the row. But that would require a lot of threads. However, for a 2D tensor with M rows and N columns, the total number of elements is M*N. So if each thread processes one element, the total number of threads is M*N, which could be large. But Trit

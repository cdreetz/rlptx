Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to compute the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. So for each row (each M element), I need to sum all the elements in that row and then divide by N. But since Triton is a GPU programming language, I need to handle this with parallelism.

The input tensor is 2D, shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

Now, considering the memory layout. The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. For each row, I need to process all N elements. So, for each row, I can process all N elements in that row.

Next, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels use warp-level parallelism. A common approach is to use a block size that's a multiple of the warp size (32). Let's say we use BLOCK_SIZE = 256. But since each row has N elements, the number of elements per block depends on N. However, since N can vary, we need to handle it with a loop.

Wait, but for each row, we need to sum N elements. So, for each row, the number of elements is N. So, the kernel should process each row in parallel. So, each thread should handle a specific row. But how to organize the threads.

Alternatively, each thread can handle a specific element in the row. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, each thread can process a chunk of elements in the row. But since the row is of length N, and each thread can process a certain number of elements, but that depends on how many elements per thread.

But maybe it's better to have each thread process a single element in the row. But that would require each thread to process one element, and then sum them up. However, since the rows are processed in parallel, each row's sum can be computed independently.

Wait, but for each row, the threads can be divided into groups that process elements in that row. So, for each row, we can have multiple threads processing elements in that row. But how to organize that.

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured such that each thread processes a single row. But that would require that each thread is responsible for one row. But that might not be efficient if N is small. However, for a 2D tensor, each row is of length N, so each thread can process one row. But how to handle that.

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured with each thread processing a single element in the row. But then, for each row, the threads would need to process all N elements. But that would require that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. However, for a row, there are N elements, so if each thread processes one element, then for each row, there are N threads. But since the kernel is designed to process multiple rows in parallel, perhaps the threads are divided into groups that process different rows.

Wait, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single row. Then, for each row, the thread would process all N elements in that row. But that would require that each thread has to process N elements, which might not be efficient. However, if the kernel is designed to process each row in parallel, then each thread can handle a single row, and for that row, it can sum all elements.

But how to organize that. Let me think about the kernel's parameters. The input tensor is of shape [M, N], and the output is [M]. So, the kernel needs to process each row (M rows) and compute the sum of each row, then divide by N.

So, the kernel should have a loop over the rows. Each thread can handle a specific row. For each row, the thread needs to sum all N elements in that row. Then, after summing, divide by N to get the mean.

But how to structure the threads. Let me think about the kernel's grid and block dimensions. The kernel should have a grid of M blocks, each block processing one row. But that might not be efficient, as each block would process one row, and each block would have multiple threads processing elements in that row.

Alternatively, perhaps each block is responsible for processing a certain number of rows. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, each thread is responsible for a single element in a row. But then, for each row, the threads would need to process all N elements. However, that would require that for each row, there are N threads processing that row's elements. But that's not feasible if the number of threads per block is

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to compute the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. So for each row (each M element), I need to sum all the elements in that row and then divide by N. Since it's a mean reduction along the last dimension, each row's sum is divided by N.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels typically use a grid of blocks, each processing a portion of the data. For a 2D tensor, each block can handle a row. But since each row has N elements, the block size needs to be chosen such that each thread can process a single element in the row. However, since we need to sum all elements in a row, maybe each thread can handle one element, and the threads in a warp can sum their results. Alternatively, using a block size that allows for efficient accumulation.

Wait, but for each row, we need to sum N elements. So, if each thread handles one element, then each block can process a row. But how many threads per block? Let's think about the block size. Let's say each block handles one row. Then, for each row, the block has N elements. But with N possibly being large, maybe we need to split the row into multiple threads. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block can process 128 elements of a row. But since each row has N elements, the number of blocks needed would be M (number of rows) multiplied by the number of blocks per row. Wait, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, each thread can process one element in a row. So for each row, there are N elements. So for each row, we need N threads. But if the block size is 128, then each block can handle up to 128 elements. So for a row with N elements, the number of blocks needed per row is ceil(N / 128). But that might be inefficient. Alternatively, maybe each block handles a row, and the threads within the block process each element of the row. But if N is large, that could be a problem. However, for the purpose of this kernel, maybe it's manageable.

But perhaps a better approach is to have each thread process one element in the row, and then the block sums the elements. But since each row is processed by a block, perhaps the block is responsible for a single row. So for each row, the block has N elements. But that might not be efficient if N is large. Alternatively, maybe the block is responsible for a single row, and each thread in the block processes a single element in that row. Then, the block can sum all the elements in the row.

So, the kernel would have each thread process one element of a row. The block would then sum the elements of the row. Then, the block's sum is stored in the output.

But how to structure the kernel. Let me think about the parameters. The input tensor is [M, N], and the output is [M]. So, each row is processed independently.

So, the kernel needs to iterate over each row, and for each row, sum all the elements. Then, divide by N.

So, the steps are:

1. For each row i in 0 to M-1:
   a. Sum all elements in row i (from column 0 to N-1)
   b. Divide the sum by N to get the mean.

Now, in Triton, the kernel will have a grid of blocks. Each block can handle one row. For each row, the block will process all N elements.

But how to structure the threads. Let's think about the grid. The grid is determined by the number of rows. Each block processes one row. The number of blocks is M. But if M is large, that's okay. But for each block, the threads need to process the elements in that row.

So, for each block, the threads will process the elements in the row. Let's say the block has a number of threads equal to the number of elements in the row. But that's not feasible if N is large. So, perhaps the block is responsible for a row, and each thread in the block processes a single element. But how to handle that.

Alternatively, the block can be responsible for a row, and each thread in the block processes a single element. But the number of threads per block is determined by the block size. So

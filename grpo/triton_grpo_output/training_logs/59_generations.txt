Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sigmoid of a 1D tensor. Let me start by recalling what the sigmoid function is. Sigmoid is defined as 1 / (1 + exp(-x)), but for numerical stability, sometimes people use a different approach, like using exp(x) when x is positive and 1/(1+exp(-x)) otherwise. But for a simple implementation, maybe I can just compute it directly.

First, the input is a 1D tensor of size N. The output should be the same size. So the kernel needs to process each element in the input tensor and compute the sigmoid for each.

Now, considering Triton's memory access patterns. Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for GPU memory. The key is to make sure that each thread processes a contiguous block of data, and that memory accesses are coalesced.

The input and output tensors are likely to be in global memory. So each thread will load a value from the input, compute the sigmoid, and store it to the output.

But how to structure the kernel? The @triton.jit decorator needs to be used. The kernel should take the input and output tensors, along with the size N. The threads will be divided into blocks, and each block will handle a certain number of elements.

Let me think about the block size. For a 1D tensor, each thread can handle one element. But maybe using a block size of 1 is too slow. Alternatively, maybe using a larger block size, but since each element is independent, perhaps each thread can process one element. However, in Triton, the block size is usually chosen to be a power of two for efficiency. But for a 1D tensor, each thread can handle one element, so the block size could be 1, but that might not be efficient. Wait, but in Triton, the block size is the number of threads per block. So if I have a block size of 1, each thread handles one element. But if the block size is larger, like 256, then each thread would handle a chunk of elements. However, since the sigmoid is a per-element operation, each thread can process one element. So maybe the block size is 1, but that's not efficient. Wait, no, the block size is the number of threads per block. So if I have a block size of 256, then each block can process 256 elements. But that would require that each thread in the block processes one element. So the kernel would have to loop through each element in the input, and for each element, compute the sigmoid.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. So perhaps the kernel is structured as follows: each thread is responsible for processing one element. The kernel is launched with a number of blocks that is determined by the size of the input. For example, if the input is size N, then the number of blocks is ceil(N / BLOCK_SIZE). But since each thread is processing one element, the block size is 1. But that's not efficient. Alternatively, maybe the block size is larger, but each thread processes one element. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The block size is the number of threads per block. So if I have a block size of 256, then each block can process 256 elements. But each thread in the block would process one element. So the kernel would have a loop that iterates over each element, and each thread in the block would handle one element. But how to structure that.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is written with a loop that iterates over the elements, and each thread is responsible for a single element. So for each element, the thread loads the input value, computes the sigmoid, and stores it to the output.

So the kernel would look like this:

@triton.jit
def kernel(input, output, N):
    pid = tl.program_id()
    x = tl.load(input + pid)
    y = 1.0 / (1.0 + tl.exp(-x))
    tl.store(output + pid, y)

But that's a very simple kernel. However, this would have each thread handle one element, which is correct. But for large N, this might not be efficient because each thread is loading and storing one element. However, in Triton, the memory access is optimized for this kind of operation. But maybe there's a better way.

Wait, but the problem says to have efficient memory access patterns. So perhaps using a larger block size, but with each thread processing one element. However, the block size is the number of threads per block. So if the block size is 256, then each block can process 256 elements. But each thread in the block would process one element. So the kernel would need to loop through each element in the

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sigmoid of a 1D tensor. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the sigmoid function is Ïƒ(x) = 1 / (1 + e^-x). But for numerical stability, I remember that when x is very large positive, we can compute it as 1, and when x is very large negative, we compute it as 0. So maybe I should handle those cases to avoid overflow.

The input is a 1D tensor of size N. The output should be the same shape. So each element in the input is processed individually.

Now, Triton kernels work with threads in blocks. I need to decide on the block size. Typically, for such operations, a block size of 256 is common, but maybe 128 or 64? Well, for a 1D tensor, each thread can handle one element. So maybe each thread processes one element. But if the tensor is large, maybe using a block size that allows multiple threads to process elements in parallel. Wait, but for a 1D tensor, each element is independent, so each thread can process one element. So the block size can be set to 256, and each thread handles one element. But maybe that's not optimal. Alternatively, maybe using a block size of 1, but that would be inefficient. Wait, no. For each element, a thread can process it. So the block size can be set to 256, and each thread processes one element. But the number of threads per block would be N, but that's not possible if N is large. Wait, no. Wait, in Triton, the kernel is launched with a certain number of blocks and threads per block. For example, if the tensor has N elements, and each block has 256 threads, then the number of blocks would be ceil(N / 256). But in the kernel, each thread would process one element. So the kernel would have to loop over each element in the input.

Wait, but how to handle the indices. Let me think. The kernel will have a loop over the elements. Each thread will process one element. So for each thread, we get the index, then compute the sigmoid.

But how to handle the memory access. The input tensor is a 1D array. So each thread will load the value at index i, compute sigmoid, and store it in the output tensor.

But for efficient memory access, we need to make sure that each thread accesses the input and output in a way that minimizes bank conflicts. Since each thread is accessing a different element, the memory access is sequential, so there's no conflict. But in Triton, the memory is accessed via pointers, and each thread can have its own pointer.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. For example, the kernel might look like:

@triton.jit
def kernel(inputs, outputs, N):
    pid = tl.program_id(0)
    i = pid
    x = tl.load(inputs + i)
    # compute sigmoid
    # store to outputs

But that's for a 1D case. However, the problem is that for very large N, this approach might not be efficient. But for a 1D tensor, each element is independent, so this approach is acceptable.

But maybe using a block size of 256, and each thread handles one element. However, the problem is that if the number of elements is not a multiple of the block size, then some threads might be idle. But Triton handles that with the program_id.

But for the sigmoid function, we need to compute it efficiently. Let's think about the computation. The standard formula is 1/(1 + exp(-x)). But for very large x, exp(-x) is zero, so the result is 1. For very small x, exp(-x) is approximately 1, so the result is 0.5. But to avoid overflow, we can compute the sigmoid in a way that avoids very large exponents.

An alternative approach is to compute the sigmoid using the formula:

if x >= 0:
    return 1.0 / (1.0 + exp(-x))
else:
    return exp(x) / (1.0 + exp(x))

But that's the same as the original formula. However, for x very large positive, exp(-x) is zero, so the result is 1. For x very large negative, exp(x) is zero, so the result is 0. So maybe we can compute it using the formula:

if x >= 0:
    sig = 1.0 / (1.0 + exp(-x))
else:
    sig = exp(x) / (1.0 + exp(x))

But how to implement this in Triton. Well,

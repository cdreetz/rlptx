Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is to sum each column of the tensor. So for each column (which is along the N dimension), we need to add up all the elements in that column. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding column.

Let me recall how Triton kernels work. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA, but with more flexibility. The kernel will process elements in blocks, and each block will handle a portion of the data.

So, the input tensor is 2D, with shape [M, N]. The output is a 1D tensor of size M. Each element in the output is the sum of the elements in the corresponding column of the input.

Now, considering the memory layout. The input tensor is stored in row-major order, which is the standard for CUDA. So, each row is stored contiguously. For a 2D tensor, the element at (i, j) is located at index i*N + j. But in Triton, when we access the tensor, we need to make sure we're accessing the correct positions.

But since we're summing along the last dimension (N), each block will need to process a range of columns. Wait, no. Wait, the last dimension is N, so each column is along the N dimension. Wait, the tensor is [M, N], so each column is of length M. So, for each column j (from 0 to N-1), we need to sum all elements in that column.

But how to structure the kernel. Let me think about the threads per block. Let's say each block handles a single column. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, each block can handle multiple columns, but that depends on how the threads are arranged.

Wait, perhaps the kernel should process each column. Let me think: for each column j, we need to sum all the elements in that column. So, for each column j, the elements are at positions (i, j) for i from 0 to M-1.

But how to organize the threads. Let me think of the kernel as processing each column. So, each thread in the block can handle a single element in the column. But that would require that each thread is responsible for one element. However, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each thread can handle a range of elements in the column, but that's not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element in the column. But for a column, there are M elements. So, if we have a block size of, say, 1024, then each block can handle up to 1024 elements. But since each column has M elements, the number of blocks needed would be ceil(N / blocks_per_column). Wait, but that's not right. Wait, the columns are N in number. So if each block handles one column, then the number of blocks is N. But if each block handles multiple columns, that might not be possible.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the kernel as processing each column. So, for each column j, we need to sum all elements in that column. So, the kernel needs to process all columns. So, the kernel's grid should have N blocks, each block handling one column. But that's not efficient if N is large, but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps that's acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel can process multiple columns in parallel. But that would require that each thread is responsible for a certain number of elements in different columns. But that's more complex.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel can process each element in the column. Let me think: for each column j, the elements are (i, j) for i from 0 to M-1. So, for each column, the sum is sum_{i=0}^{M-1} input[i][j].

So, the kernel should iterate over each column j, and for each column, sum all the elements in that column.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The input is a 2D tensor, and the output is a 1D tensor of size M.

So, the kernel will have to process each column. Let me think of the kernel as having a loop over the columns. For each column j, we need to sum all the elements in that column.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a grid and a block. So, perhaps the kernel is structured as follows:

- The grid is determined by the number of columns N. Each block handles one column.

But in Triton, the grid is

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum each column of the tensor. So for each column (which is along the second dimension, since the tensor is [M, N]), we need to add up all the elements in that column. So for each row in the first dimension (M), we'll have a column in the second dimension (N). Wait, no, actually, the last dimension is N. So the reduction is over the N dimension. So for each row in the M dimension, we need to sum across the N elements. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the tensor is [M, N], so the last dimension is N. So the reduction is along the N dimension. So for each row in M, we sum all the elements in that row. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, if the tensor is [M, N], then each element is at position (i, j), where i ranges from 0 to M-1 and j from 0 to N-1. Summing along the last dimension (N) would mean for each i, sum over j. So the result is a tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the i-th row.

So the kernel needs to process each row (i) and sum all elements in that row. So for each row, we need to iterate through all columns (j) and add them up.

Now, the input and output tensors. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output is a 1D tensor of shape [M], with each element being the sum of the corresponding row.

Next, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels use a grid and a block structure. For a 2D tensor, each block can process a row. So each block can handle one row. But since each row has N elements, the block needs to process all N elements in that row. However, the block size is usually chosen based on the problem. Let's think about how to structure the kernel.

Each thread in the block can handle a single element in the row. But if the block size is larger than N, then threads might not be needed. Alternatively, maybe each thread handles a single element. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, if N is large, we can have each thread process a portion of the row. But for sum reduction, it's easier to have each thread process one element, and then the threads in the block can sum their values.

But how to structure this. Let's think of the kernel as processing each row. Each row has N elements. So for each row i, the block processes all elements in that row. So the block size should be such that each block handles one row. But how to split the work.

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured such that each thread processes a single element in the row. Then, the block can sum all the elements in the row. So for each row i, the block has multiple threads, each handling a column j in that row. Then, the block's shared memory can accumulate the sum.

But for a 2D tensor, the memory layout is row-major. So for a given row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j for j in 0..N-1. So the kernel needs to load each element in the row and sum them.

So the steps:

1. For each row i in the input tensor, compute the sum of all elements in that row.

Now, the kernel needs to process each row. So the grid is determined by the number of rows M. Each block processes one row. So the grid is M blocks. Each block has multiple threads, each handling a column in the row.

But how to structure the threads. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block can have up to 128 threads. Each thread can handle a single element in the row. But if N is larger than the block size, then each block can process multiple elements. However, for sum reduction, the threads in the block can sum their individual elements.

But for a row of N elements, each thread in the block can take care of a single element. Then, the block can sum all the elements in the row. However, if the block size is larger than N, then some threads may not be needed. So the block size should be chosen such that it can handle up to N elements. But for a general case, we can set the block size to a value that is a multiple of the number of elements per row.

But since the number of elements per row (N) can vary, it's better to have the block size be a value that allows for efficient processing. For

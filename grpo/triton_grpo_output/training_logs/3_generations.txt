Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum each column of the tensor. So for each column (which is along the N dimension), we need to add up all the elements in that column. The input is a 2D tensor with M rows and N columns. The output should be a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the sum of the corresponding column.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is [M, N], and the output is [M]. The memory layout is important. Since we're dealing with a 2D tensor, it's likely stored in row-major order. So each row is contiguous in memory. For the kernel, each thread will handle a specific row, but since we're summing columns, maybe each thread should handle a specific column? Wait, no. Wait, the sum is along the last dimension, which is N. So for each column (index i in 0..N-1), sum all elements in that column. But how to structure the threads to do this?

Wait, the kernel needs to process each column. So perhaps the threads are organized such that each thread is responsible for a specific column. But how to map that. Alternatively, maybe each thread processes a single element in the tensor, and then accumulates the sum for their column. But that might be less efficient. Let me think about the best way.

In Triton, each thread is responsible for a certain element. But for a sum reduction, we can have each thread process a certain element, and then combine the results. However, since we need to sum along the last dimension (columns), each thread would need to process elements in the same column. So perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a certain column, and then sums all the elements in that column.

But how to handle that. Let me think about the thread index. Let's say we have N columns. Each thread can be assigned to a column. But if the number of threads is not a multiple of N, then we need to handle that. Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed to process each element in the tensor, but for each column, we accumulate the sum. But that might require more complex logic.

Alternatively, think of the kernel as processing each column. Let's say that for each column i, we have a thread that sums all the elements in that column. But how to do that in Triton. Since each thread can process a single element, but for a column, there are M elements. So perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the tensor, and then for each column, we accumulate the sum. But that would require a reduction across the rows for each column.

Wait, but that might not be efficient. Let me think again. The sum along the last dimension (columns) would be equivalent to for each column i, sum over all rows j of tensor[j][i]. So the kernel needs to compute for each column i, the sum of all elements in that column.

So, how to structure the threads. Let's say that each thread is responsible for a single element in the tensor. Then, for each column, we need to sum all elements in that column. But how to do that in a kernel.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured to process each column. For example, if we have N columns, and each thread is assigned to a column. Then, for each column, the thread would sum all the elements in that column. However, this would require that each thread can process all elements in a column. But how to do that with Triton's thread structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread processes a single element, and then for each column, we perform a reduction across the rows. But that would require that each thread is responsible for a single element in the column, and then we have a reduction over the rows for each column.

But how to manage that. Let me think about the kernel's parameters. The input tensor is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N]. The output is a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the sum of the column i.

So, the kernel needs to process each column. Let's say that the kernel is designed to process each column. So for each column i, the kernel would sum all the elements in that column. But how to do that with Triton.

In Triton, each thread is assigned a unique index. So perhaps the kernel is designed to have each thread handle a specific column. But that would require that the number of threads is equal to the number of columns N. However, in Triton, the number of threads is determined by the kernel's grid size. So, for example

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum over the columns (since the last dimension is N). So for each row in the tensor, I need to add up all the elements in that row. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the tensor is [M, N], so the last dimension is N. So the reduction is along the N dimension. So each row (M) has N elements, and we need to sum each row. So the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding row.

So the kernel needs to process each row, sum its elements. How to do this in Triton?

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. The output is a 1D tensor with shape [M]. The kernel will process each row, so each thread should handle one row. But how to organize the threads?

Triton kernels use a grid and a block structure. For this problem, I can have each thread handle a single row. So the number of threads per block would be 1, and the number of blocks would be M. But wait, maybe that's not efficient. Alternatively, maybe each block can handle multiple rows, but since the rows are independent, it's better to have each thread handle one row. But with M possibly being large, maybe we need to have multiple threads per block.

Wait, but for a sum reduction, each thread can process a single row. So for each row, the thread would load all N elements, sum them, and store the result. But if N is large, that could be a problem. However, Triton can handle this with proper memory access patterns.

But wait, the problem is that for each row, the thread needs to access N elements. If N is large, then each thread would have to load N elements, which could be slow. So maybe we need to optimize the memory access by using a block size that allows for efficient access. But since the rows are independent, perhaps each thread can process a single row, and the block size can be set to 1, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can have multiple threads per block, but that would complicate the logic.

Alternatively, maybe we can process each row in a way that uses shared memory. But for a sum reduction, perhaps it's better to process each row in a single thread.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensor is [M, N]. So each row is contiguous in memory. So for a given row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j for j from 0 to N-1.

So each thread can be responsible for row i. So the thread index in the grid would be i. But how to map the thread index to the row. For example, if we have a grid of size M, each thread is assigned a row i. Then, for each row i, the thread needs to sum all elements in that row.

But how to handle this in Triton. The kernel will be written with a grid of size M, and each thread is responsible for a row. So the kernel's code would have:

@triton.jit
def kernel(...):
    i = tl.program_id(0)
    # process row i

But then, for each row i, the thread needs to load all N elements. So for each j in 0..N-1, load the value from [i, j], sum them, and store the result in output[i].

But if N is large, this would be O(N) per thread, which could be slow. However, Triton is optimized for this kind of operation. But maybe we can find a way to process this more efficiently.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a block size that allows for more efficient memory access. For example, if we have a block size of 1, then each thread handles one row. But if the block size is larger, maybe we can have multiple threads per block, but that would complicate the logic.

But given that the rows are independent, it's probably best to have each thread handle a single row. So the grid size is M, and each thread is responsible for one row.

Now, for the memory access. The input tensor is a 2D tensor. So for row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j. So for each j in 0 to N-1, the element is at (i, j). So in the kernel, for a given row i, we can loop over j from 0 to N-1, load each element, sum them, and store the result in output[i].

But in Triton, loops

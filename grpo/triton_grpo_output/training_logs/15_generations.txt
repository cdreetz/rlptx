Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the minimum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the minimum element). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the minimum of N elements.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Since we're processing rows, each threadblock should handle one row. But how many threads per block? Let's think about the number of elements per row (N). If N is large, we need enough threads to process all elements in a row. Let's choose a block size that's a power of two, maybe 256, but that might be too big. Alternatively, maybe 128 or 64. But since each thread can handle one element, perhaps the block size is determined by the number of elements per row. However, since the number of elements per row (N) can vary, we need to make the block size flexible. Wait, but in Triton, the block size is fixed per kernel. So maybe we can use a block size that's a power of two, and then use a loop over the elements in the row. For example, if each thread processes one element, then the number of threads per block would be N, but that's not feasible if N is large. Alternatively, maybe we can use a block size that's a power of two, and have each thread process a chunk of elements. But for min reduction, it's more efficient to have each thread process one element, and then perform a reduction across the threads. Wait, but in this case, since we're reducing along the row, each row is processed independently. So for each row, we can have a threadblock that processes all elements in that row, and then compute the minimum.

Wait, but how to structure the threads. Let's think: For each row (M rows), we need to process N elements. Each thread can handle one element. So for each row, we need N threads. But if N is large, say 1024, then a block with 1024 threads would be needed. But Triton allows us to have a block size that's a power of two. So perhaps we can set the block size to 256, and then for each row, have multiple threads processing elements in that row. However, the problem is that the number of elements per row (N) can vary. So maybe we need to use a dynamic block size, but Triton doesn't support that. Therefore, the block size is fixed, and we have to handle cases where N is not a multiple of the block size.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each threadblock processes one row, and within the threadblock, the threads process the elements of that row. For example, if the block size is 256, then each threadblock handles one row, and each thread in the block processes one element. But that would require that N is a multiple of the block size. But if N is not a multiple, then some elements would be left. So perhaps we need to use a loop over the elements in the row, and have each thread process one element. However, for that, the block size would be determined by the number of elements per row. But since the kernel is written once, the block size has to be fixed. Therefore, perhaps the block size is set to 256, and for each row, the threads process the elements in that row, but if the number of elements is less than the block size, then the extra threads would be masked out.

Wait, but the kernel needs to be efficient. Let's think about the steps:

1. For each row in the input tensor (each row is of length N), compute the minimum value.

So the kernel needs to process each row. Each threadblock can handle one row. The number of threads per block would be the number of elements in the row (N), but that's not feasible if N is large. Therefore, maybe the kernel is structured with a block size that's a power of two, and each threadblock processes one row. The threads within the block process the elements of the row. However, if N is not a multiple of the block size, then some elements would be left. But that's not acceptable. Therefore, perhaps we need to use a different approach.

Alternatively, for each row, we can have a threadblock that processes all elements in that row. For example, if the

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the min reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the minimum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the minimum element). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the minimum of N elements.

Now, considering how Triton works, I need to structure the kernel to process these elements efficiently. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows for high-performance kernels using CUDA-like syntax but with more flexibility. The key is to use shared memory and proper memory access patterns to maximize throughput.

Let me think about the input and output. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

For the kernel, each thread will handle a specific row. But since each row has N elements, I need to process all elements in that row. However, in Triton, each thread can process a single element, but with proper grouping, we can process multiple elements in parallel.

Wait, but for a reduction (min), we need to process all elements in a row and find the minimum. So, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, but then we need to perform a reduction across all elements in the row. But how to do that efficiently?

Alternatively, maybe we can use a block to process all elements in a row. For example, each block processes a row, and within the block, the threads perform a reduction to find the minimum.

But how to structure this. Let's think about the grid and blocks. The grid should have M blocks, each handling a row. Each block will process the elements in that row. The number of threads per block would depend on N. For example, if N is large, we might need multiple threads per block to process all elements in the row.

But for a min reduction, the standard approach is to have each thread process a subset of the elements and then perform a reduction. However, since the elements are in a row, perhaps we can process them in a way that each thread takes a portion of the row and then reduces across the threads.

Alternatively, since the row is of length N, each thread can process one element, and then the threads in the block can perform a reduction to find the minimum. But for that, the number of threads per block should be a power of two, or at least a number that allows for efficient reduction.

But how to handle the case where N is not a power of two? Well, Triton's reduction can handle that by using a mask or by padding. However, for this problem, since we're processing all elements in the row, perhaps we can use a block that has enough threads to process all elements in the row.

Let me think about the parameters. The input tensor is [M, N], and the output is [M]. Each thread will process one element in the row. So, for each row, the number of threads needed is N. But if N is large, that could be a problem. However, Triton allows for dynamic grid and block sizes, so perhaps we can set the block size to a reasonable number, like 256, and have multiple blocks per row.

Wait, but if each block is responsible for a row, then the number of blocks is M. Each block will have a certain number of threads. For example, if each block has 256 threads, then each block can process up to 256 elements in the row. But if N is larger than 256, then we need multiple blocks per row. Wait, no, because each block is responsible for a single row. So if the row has N elements, then the block needs to process all N elements. So the number of threads per block should be at least N. But that's not feasible if N is large. So perhaps the approach is to have each thread process a single element, and then perform a reduction across all threads in the block to find the minimum.

But how to do that. Let me think of the standard reduction approach. For a reduction, each thread is responsible for a certain element, and then the threads perform a reduction. For example, in a 2D tensor, if we have a block with 256 threads, each thread can take a chunk of elements and reduce them.

But in this case, the row is of length N. So, for each row, the block will process all N elements. The threads in the block will each take one element, and then perform a reduction to find the minimum. However, the number of threads per block must be at least N. But if N is larger than the block size, then the block can't

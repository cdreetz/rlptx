Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is to sum all elements in each row of the tensor. So for each row (each M element), we need to add up all N elements. The input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding row.

Now, considering Triton kernels, I need to figure out the grid and block sizes. Since we're dealing with a 2D tensor, each block should process a row. But wait, maybe each block can handle multiple rows? Or maybe each row is processed by a separate thread? Let me think about the memory layout.

The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. For a 2D tensor [M, N], each row has N elements. So, for each row i, the elements are at positions i*N to i*N + N - 1.

In Triton, the kernel will have to iterate over each row, and then sum the elements in that row. So, the kernel should process each row in parallel. Let's consider the thread per row. If we have M rows, then each thread can handle one row. But how to structure the threads?

Alternatively, maybe each block processes a single row. So, the number of blocks would be M, and each block handles one row. But how to split the rows into blocks? Well, the grid size would be M, and each block processes one row.

But wait, in Triton, the kernel is launched with a grid of (num_blocks, ) and each block has a certain number of threads. For example, if each block has 1 thread, then the grid size is M. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each block can process multiple rows, but that depends on the block size.

Wait, perhaps the optimal approach is to have each thread handle a single element in the row. But that would require a lot of threads. Alternatively, using a block size that can process multiple elements per thread.

But for sum reduction, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then they accumulate the sum. But that's not efficient. Alternatively, we can have each thread handle a chunk of elements in the row, but that depends on the block size.

Alternatively, for each row, we can have multiple threads in a block that compute the sum. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block can process multiple elements in a row. But since the row is of length N, we need to figure out how to split the elements into chunks.

Wait, but the problem is that for each row, we need to sum all N elements. So, perhaps each thread in the block is responsible for a portion of the row. For example, if the block has 128 threads, then each thread can handle 128 elements, but that's only if N is large enough. However, if N is smaller than the block size, then we need to handle that.

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then they accumulate the sum. But that would require a lot of threads. However, for a row of N elements, the number of threads per block would be N, but that's not feasible if N is large.

Wait, but the problem is that for each row, the sum is over all elements. So, the kernel needs to process each row, and for each row, sum all elements. So, the kernel can be structured as follows:

- Each thread is responsible for a single element in a row. But since there are M rows, each with N elements, the total number of elements is M*N. So, the kernel needs to process all elements.

But how to structure this. Maybe the kernel is designed to process each element in the tensor, and for each element, add it to the corresponding row's sum. But that would require a lot of threads.

Alternatively, think of the kernel as processing each row in parallel. For each row, we can have multiple threads that compute the sum. For example, if each block has 128 threads, then each block can process a row by having the threads sum the elements in that row.

But how to split the elements in the row into chunks. For example, if the row has N elements, and the block has 128 threads, then each thread can handle N / 128 elements. But that's only if N is a multiple of 128. Otherwise, we need to handle the remainder.

But perhaps a better approach is to have each thread handle a single element in the row, and then accumulate the sum.

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum over the last dimension, which is N. So for each row in the tensor (each row is of length N), we need to sum all the elements. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding row.

Next, input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. The output is a 1D tensor with shape [M]. The memory layout is important here. The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. For Triton, we'll need to access elements in a way that takes advantage of coalesced memory access.

Now, block sizes and memory access patterns. Since we're processing each row, each threadblock should handle one row. So, the number of threadblocks should be M. Each threadblock will process one row. The number of threads per block depends on how many elements are in each row. For a row of N elements, if we have a block size of, say, 128, then each block can process up to 128 elements. But since N can vary, maybe we should use a dynamic block size. However, in Triton, the block size is fixed. So perhaps we can set the block size to 128, and each thread in the block handles one element in the row. But wait, if N is not a multiple of 128, then some threads in the block will be idle. Alternatively, we can have each threadblock process a range of elements in the row, but that might complicate things. Wait, no. Since each row is processed independently, each threadblock can handle one row. So for each row, we can have multiple threads processing each element in the row. Wait, maybe I should think of it as each threadblock handles one row, and each thread in the block processes one element in that row. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, each threadblock can process a chunk of elements in the row. But for a sum reduction, it's more efficient to have each thread process one element and then accumulate the sum. But how to do that in a threadblock.

Wait, the standard approach for sum reduction in Triton is to have each thread process a single element, and then the threadblock reduces the sum across its threads. But since each row is processed independently, perhaps each threadblock is responsible for a single row. So, for each row, the threadblock will sum all the elements in that row.

So, the steps would be:

1. For each row i in 0 to M-1:
   a. For each element j in 0 to N-1:
      i. Load the value from input[i][j]
   b. Sum all the values in the row and store the result in output[i]

But how to structure this in Triton. Let me think about the kernel parameters. The kernel will take the input tensor, the output tensor, and the dimensions M and N. The kernel will iterate over each row, and for each row, iterate over each element in the row, sum them, and store the result.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a grid and a block. The grid size is determined by the number of rows, M. Each threadblock will handle one row. Then, within each threadblock, we need to process all elements in that row. However, the number of threads per block depends on the number of elements per row. For example, if each row has N elements, then the number of threads per block should be N. But if N is large, this could be a problem. However, in Triton, the number of threads per block is fixed. So perhaps we can use a block size that is a power of two, and then handle the elements in the row in a way that each thread processes one element. But for that, each threadblock will have N threads, but that's not possible if N is not a power of two. Alternatively, we can have each threadblock process a chunk of elements, but that might complicate the reduction.

Wait, maybe the standard approach is to have each threadblock process a single row, and each thread in the block processes one element in the row. Then, the threadblock reduces the sum across its threads. But how to do that. For example, if the block has 128 threads, then each thread can process one element in the row. Then, the block's threads can perform a reduction to sum all the elements in the row.

But how to handle the case where the row has fewer elements than the block size. For example,

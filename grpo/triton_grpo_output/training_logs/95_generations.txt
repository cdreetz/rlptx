Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the maximum value in that row). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the max of N elements.

Now, considering how Triton works, I need to structure the kernel to process elements in a way that's efficient on the GPU. Triton kernels are written in a way that's similar to CUDA, using threads, blocks, and memory access patterns that are optimized for coalesced access.

Let me think about the input and output. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the max of the corresponding row.

For the kernel, each thread will process a single element in the output. But how to handle the reduction along the N dimension? Since each row has N elements, each thread needs to find the maximum in that row.

But wait, in Triton, each thread can handle a single element, but for a reduction, we need to have a way to compute the max across multiple elements. However, since the reduction is along the last dimension, and each row is independent, maybe we can process each row in parallel.

Wait, but for each row, we need to compute the max of N elements. So for each row, we can have a thread that processes all elements in that row. But with multiple threads per row, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then we perform a reduction across the elements in the row.

But how to structure that. Let's think about the thread index. Let's say each thread is assigned to a specific row. For example, if there are M rows, and each row has N elements, then each thread can be assigned to a row. But for each row, how do we compute the max?

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then we perform a reduction across all elements in the row. But that would require that each thread is part of a warp that can perform a reduction.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to have each thread handle a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction across the elements in the row. But for that, we need to have a way to collect all the elements in the row and compute the maximum.

But how to do that in Triton. Let's think of the kernel as processing each row. For each row, we need to compute the max of N elements. So, for each row, we can have a group of threads that work together to compute the max.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is assigned to a specific row, and then within that row, the thread is responsible for a specific element. But then, how to compute the max across all elements in the row.

Wait, maybe the approach is to have each thread process a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction across the elements in the row. But for that, the threads need to be arranged in a way that allows for parallel reduction.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. So perhaps the kernel is structured as follows:

- Each thread is responsible for a specific row (i) and a specific element in that row (j). But for each row, we need to compute the max of all elements in that row. So, for each row, we can have multiple threads working together to compute the max.

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then the threads in the same row work together to compute the max. But how to organize that.

Alternatively, since the reduction is along the last dimension, perhaps we can process each row in parallel, and for each row, compute the max of N elements. So, for each row, we can have a group of threads that compute the max. But how to structure that.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensor is [M, N], so each row is of length N. The output is [M], each element is the max of the corresponding row.

So, for each row i, we need to compute the maximum of the elements from column 0 to N-1 in row i.

In Triton, each thread can be assigned to a specific row. For example, if we have M rows, and each thread is responsible for a row, then for each row, we need to process all N elements.

But how to do that. Let's think about the thread index. Suppose that each thread is assigned to a row. So, for a given row i, the

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the tensor, find the maximum value). So for each row in the tensor, which has N elements, we need to compute the maximum. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the maximum of the corresponding row.

Now, considering how Triton works, I need to structure the kernel to process each row. Each thread will handle a row. But wait, Triton is a GPU programming language, so I need to think about how to partition the work. Since the tensor is 2D, with M rows and N columns, each row has N elements. So for each row, we need to process all N elements and find the max.

But how to structure the threads. Let's think about the grid and blocks. The kernel will be launched with a grid that has M blocks, each block handling one row. But wait, maybe not. Alternatively, each thread can process a single element in the row. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each thread processes a group of elements in the row, but since the max is a reduction, perhaps each thread can handle a subset of the elements and then combine the results.

Wait, for a max reduction, the standard approach is to use a reduction. So, for each row, we can process the elements in a way that each thread takes a chunk of elements and computes the max, then combine them. But how to do that in Triton.

Let me recall that in Triton, each thread can process a certain range of elements. For example, for a row of N elements, we can divide the elements into groups, and each thread computes the max of its group, then combines with others. But since the max is associative, we can do this.

But first, the input tensor is 2D, with shape [M, N]. So each row is of length N. The output is [M], each element is the max of the row.

So, the kernel needs to process each row. Let's think about how to structure the threads. Let's say that each thread is responsible for a single row. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, each thread could be responsible for a subset of the elements in a row. But for the max reduction, the standard approach is to have each thread handle a portion of the elements and then combine the results.

Alternatively, perhaps for each row, we can process the elements in a way that each thread takes a chunk of elements and computes the max. For example, if the row has N elements, and we have a block size of, say, 128, then each thread can process a certain number of elements. But how to do that.

Wait, but the kernel is for a 2D tensor. Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensor is [M, N], so each row is contiguous in memory. So for a given row i, the elements are at positions i*N + 0, i*N +1, ..., i*N + N-1.

So for each row i, we need to compute the max of the elements from i*N to i*N + N-1.

So, the kernel can be structured as follows:

Each thread is responsible for a row i. Then, for that row, compute the max of all elements in that row.

But how to do that in Triton. Let's think about the grid and the block size.

The grid size would be M, since there are M rows. Each thread in the grid handles one row. But how to process the elements in that row.

Wait, but for each row, the elements are N in number. So, for each row, the thread needs to process N elements and find the max. But how to do that in a way that's efficient.

Alternatively, perhaps each thread can process a subset of the elements in the row. For example, if the block size is 128, then each thread can process a chunk of elements. But since the max is a reduction, we can use a reduction approach.

But perhaps the simplest way is to have each thread process a single element, and then perform a reduction over all elements in the row. But that would require that each thread has a value, and then they combine their values. But how to do that.

Alternatively, for each row, we can use a reduction. Let's think about the standard reduction in Triton. For example, for a 1D array, the reduction can be done by having each thread take a portion of the array and compute the max, then combine with others.

So, for a row of N elements, the kernel would process that row, and compute

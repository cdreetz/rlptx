Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, the input is a 2D tensor with dimensions M (rows) and N (columns). The task is to compute the maximum value along the last dimension, which means for each row, I need to find the maximum value among all elements in that row. So, the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the max of the corresponding row in the input.

Now, thinking about how to implement this in Triton. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA, but with more flexibility. The key is to structure the kernel to efficiently process the data using shared memory and proper memory access patterns.

Let me break down the steps:

1. **GPU Operations**: For each row in the input tensor, we need to find the maximum value. This is a reduction operation along the last dimension. Each thread will process a single element in the row, but since we need to find the maximum, we need to compare elements and keep track of the maximum.

2. **Input/Output Shapes**: The input is [M, N], and the output is [M]. Each row has N elements. The output tensor will have one element per row.

3. **Block Sizes and Memory Access**: Since each row is processed independently, we can structure the kernel such that each thread handles a single element in the row. However, since N can be large, we need to consider how to efficiently process each row. For example, if N is large, using a block size that allows multiple threads to work on a row might be better. But since the reduction is per row, maybe each thread handles a single element in the row, and then we perform a reduction across the threads in the block.

Wait, but for a reduction, the standard approach is to have each thread handle a portion of the data, and then perform a reduction across the threads. However, in this case, since the reduction is along the last dimension (columns), each row is processed independently. So for each row, the threads in a warp can work together to compute the max.

But how to structure the threads. Let's think: for each row, we can have a group of threads that process the elements in that row. For example, if the block size is 32, then each block can handle a row. But if the row has N elements, then the number of threads per block would be N. But that might not be efficient if N is large. Alternatively, we can have each thread handle a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction across the threads in the block.

Wait, but for each row, the number of elements is N. So, if each thread processes one element, then for each row, we need to have N threads. However, if the block size is larger than N, then we might have multiple blocks per row. But that's not efficient. Alternatively, if the block size is smaller than N, then each block can process a portion of the row. But this might complicate the reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps we can structure the kernel such that each thread processes a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction across the threads in the block. But for that, the number of threads per block must be a power of two, and the reduction can be done in a hierarchical way.

Alternatively, for each row, we can have a group of threads that process the elements in that row, and then compute the max. For example, if the row has N elements, and the block size is 32, then each block can process a portion of the row. But how to handle that.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then the threads in the block perform a reduction to find the maximum. But for that, the number of threads per block must be such that each thread can process one element. However, if the row has N elements, then the number of threads per block would be N. But that might not be feasible if N is large.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed for each row, and each block processes a row. So, for each row, the block processes all elements in that row. But how to do that.

Wait, let me think again. The input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. The output is [M], where each element is the max of the corresponding row. So, for each row i in 0..M-1, compute max of input[i, 0..N-1].

So, for each row, we need to process N elements. So, the kernel must process each row, and for each row, compute the max of N elements.

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the maximum element). So for each row (each M element), I need to compute the max of N elements.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the max of the corresponding row.

Memory layout: The input is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. The output is a 1D array where each element corresponds to a row's maximum.

Optimal block sizes and memory access patterns. Since each row has N elements, and we need to process all elements in a row, the block size should be chosen such that each thread can handle a portion of the row. However, since we need to find the maximum, it's more efficient to have each thread process a single element and compare with the current maximum. But for a row of N elements, if N is large, we need multiple threads per row. Alternatively, using a reduction approach where threads work together to find the max.

Wait, but in Triton, each thread can process a single element. But for a row of N elements, if we have multiple threads, each thread can take responsibility for a single element. But how to efficiently compute the max across all elements in the row.

Alternatively, using a reduction pattern where threads work in a hierarchical way. For example, for each row, we can have multiple threads that compare their elements and pass the max up. But for that, the number of threads per row should be a power of two, but since N can be arbitrary, maybe we need to handle that with a loop.

But perhaps the simplest approach is to have each thread process a single element in the row and compare it with the current max. However, this would require that each thread knows the current max, which is not straightforward. So maybe we need to use a reduction approach where threads work together to compute the max.

Alternatively, for each row, we can have a thread per element, and then perform a reduction across all elements in the row. But that would require that each row is processed by a group of threads that can perform the reduction.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The input tensor is [M, N], and the output is [M]. Each row is processed independently.

So, for each row i (from 0 to M-1), we need to compute the max of elements from column 0 to N-1 in that row.

In Triton, the kernel will have a grid of threads, each responsible for a row. But how to handle the columns in each row.

Let me think about the thread index. Let's say that each thread is responsible for a row. So, the number of threads in the grid is M. Each thread processes a row. Then, for each row, the thread needs to compute the maximum of N elements.

But how to do that. For each row, the thread can iterate over the elements in that row and compute the max. However, this would be O(N) per row, which could be slow if N is large. But Triton is optimized for such operations.

Alternatively, using a reduction approach where each thread is part of a reduction tree. For example, for each row, we can have a number of threads that work together to compute the max. But this requires that the number of threads per row is a power of two, but since N can be arbitrary, perhaps we need to use a loop-based approach.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. So, for each row, the thread can process the elements in that row. Let's think about the kernel parameters.

The kernel will have a grid of threads, each handling a row. For each row, the thread will need to process all N elements. But how to do that efficiently.

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured with a block size that allows for processing the elements in the row. For example, if the block size is 1, each thread handles one element. But that's not efficient. Alternatively, if the block size is larger, but that depends on the number of elements per row.

But perhaps the best way is to have each thread process a single element in the row and then perform a reduction across all elements in the row. However, that would require that the threads in a warp work together to compute the max.

Alternatively, for each row, the thread can iterate through the elements in that row and compute the max. But this would require that the thread

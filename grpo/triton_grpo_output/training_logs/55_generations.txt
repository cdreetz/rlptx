Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, matrix multiplication involves multiplying rows of the first matrix with columns of the second matrix. The result is a matrix of shape [M, N]. But since we're using shared memory, we need to break down the computation into tiles. Each tile will be a block of elements that can be stored in shared memory for faster access.

Let me recall how Triton works. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a high-level, Python-like syntax. The kernel will be written with the @triton.jit decorator, and it will handle the computation using threads, blocks, and shared memory.

So, the input tensors are A (M,K) and B (K,N). The output tensor C (M,N) is the result. Each thread in the kernel will compute one element of C. But to optimize, we'll use shared memory to store tiles of A and B.

Let me think about the tile size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a common tile size is 16x16 or 32x32. Let's choose 32x32 for this example. So, each thread block will handle a tile of size 32x32 from A and B.

Wait, but the actual dimensions of A and B might not be multiples of the tile size. So, we need to handle cases where the dimensions are not perfectly divisible by the tile size. That requires some masking or padding.

Now, the steps for the kernel:

1. Each thread block will compute a block of C. The block size is determined by the tile size. For example, if the tile is 32x32, then each block will handle a 32x32 region of C.

But wait, in matrix multiplication, each element of C is the sum of products of elements from A's row and B's column. So, for each element C[i][j], it's the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But with shared memory, we can load a tile of A and a tile of B into shared memory. Then, for each element in the tile, compute the sum.

So, the approach is:

- For each thread block, compute a tile of A (size TILE_M x TILE_K) and a tile of B (size TILE_K x TILE_N). Wait, but A is MxK and B is KxN. So, the tiles would be of size TILE_M x TILE_K for A and TILE_K x TILE_N for B. But since the tile size is fixed, perhaps we need to adjust the tile dimensions.

Alternatively, the tile size for A is TILE_M x TILE_K, and for B it's TILE_K x TILE_N. Then, each thread block handles a block of C of size TILE_M x TILE_N.

But how to map the threads to these tiles. Each thread in the block will compute a single element of C, but using the shared memory tiles.

Let me think about the thread indices. Each thread in the block will have a position in the tile of C. For example, if the block is responsible for computing C's rows from m_start to m_end and columns from n_start to n_end, then each thread in the block will compute a specific element.

But maybe it's better to split the problem into blocks. Each block handles a tile of A and a tile of B. For example, the block is responsible for computing a tile of C. Then, each thread in the block will compute a single element of C by multiplying the corresponding elements from the tiles of A and B.

Wait, but the tile size for A is TILE_M x TILE_K, and for B is TILE_K x TILE_N. Then, the tile of C would be TILE_M x TILE_N. So, each thread block handles a TILE_M x TILE_N block of C.

But how to compute the sum for each element of C. For each element C[i][j], it's the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, for each thread, we need to compute the sum over k for the corresponding elements in the tiles of A and B.

But if the tiles are of size TILE_K, then each thread will compute a part of the sum. Wait, maybe the threads are arranged in a way that each thread computes a single k in the sum.

Alternatively, each thread in the block is responsible for computing a single element of C by iterating over the k indices. But that would be too slow if the tile size is large.

Alternatively, the threads are arranged in a way that each thread handles a single k in the sum. For example, if the tile size is TILE_K, then each thread in the

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through the steps.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The two input matrices are A (M x K) and B (K x N), and the output is C (M x N), where each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

Since we're using shared memory, I need to figure out how to tile the matrices. The idea is to load chunks of the matrices into shared memory, compute the dot product of the chunks, and then store the result back into global memory.

So, the kernel will have to process each block of the output matrix. Let's think about the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 is common. Let's say we use a block size of 32. But I need to make sure that the tiles fit into shared memory.

For each tile in A and B, we'll compute the dot product. The key is to partition the matrices into tiles of size (block_size, block_size), where block_size is a parameter. Wait, but for matrix multiplication, the tiles would be (block_size, block_size) for A and (block_size, block_size) for B. However, since A is M x K and B is K x N, the tiles would need to be aligned such that each tile of A is multiplied by a tile of B.

But maybe I should think in terms of rows and columns. For each element in the output matrix C, we need to compute the sum over k. So, for each row i in A and column j in B, we need to compute the dot product of the row i of A and column j of B.

But using shared memory, the approach is to load a block of rows from A into shared memory, and a block of columns from B into shared memory, then compute the dot product. However, since B is stored as columns, maybe we need to transpose B when loading into shared memory.

Wait, in matrix multiplication, when using shared memory, the usual approach is to load a block of rows from A into shared memory, and a block of columns from B into shared memory. But since B is stored as columns, we need to transpose it when loading into shared memory. Alternatively, we can load the transpose of B into shared memory.

Alternatively, for each thread in the kernel, we can compute a single element of C. But that would be too slow for large matrices. So, the tile-based approach is better.

So, the kernel will have to process tiles of A and B. Let's assume that the block size is 32. So, each thread block will handle a tile of size (block_size, block_size) in A and (block_size, block_size) in B. But since A is M x K and B is K x N, the tiles would be arranged such that each tile of A is multiplied by a tile of B.

But how to structure the threads? Let's think about the threads per block. Each thread block will compute a block of the output matrix. For example, if the output matrix is M x N, then each thread block handles a block of size (block_size, block_size) in the output. But that's not exactly right. Alternatively, each thread block processes a tile of A and a tile of B, and computes the corresponding part of C.

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured such that each thread block computes a block of the output matrix. For example, each thread block is responsible for computing a block of size (block_size, block_size) in the output matrix. But that's more of a row-wise approach.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the standard Triton matrix multiplication approach. In standard Triton matrix multiplication, the kernel is structured with threads that compute individual elements of the output matrix, but with shared memory for the tiles.

But for large matrices, using a tile-based approach with shared memory is more efficient. So, the kernel would have to handle the tiles of A and B in shared memory, compute the dot product, and then store the result into the output matrix.

So, the steps would be:

1. For each tile of A (size block_size x block_size) and each tile of B (size block_size x block_size), compute the dot product and store into the output matrix.

But how to partition the matrices into tiles? For example, the input matrix A is of size M x K. So, the number of tiles in A would be ceil(M / block_size) in rows and ceil(K / block_size) in columns. Similarly for B.

But in the kernel, each thread block would handle a tile of A and a tile of B, and compute the corresponding part

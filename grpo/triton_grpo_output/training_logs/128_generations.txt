Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the maximum value). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the max of N elements.

Now, considering how Triton works, I need to figure out the GPU operations. The kernel will process elements in blocks. Since we're dealing with a 2D tensor, I should think about how to partition the data into blocks. The last dimension (N) is the one we're reducing, so each block should handle a portion of this dimension.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensor is [M, N], so each row is of length N. For each row, we need to find the maximum. So, each thread in the block should handle a single element in the row, but we need to compare them all.

Wait, but in Triton, threads are usually grouped into warps, and each warp can process multiple elements. But for a max reduction, each thread would need to compare elements and pass the maximum up. However, since the reduction is along the last dimension, perhaps each block can process a row, and each thread in the block handles a position in the row.

But how to structure this. Let me think about the block size. Let's say each block handles a single row. But if the row has N elements, then the block size should be N. However, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each block processes a portion of the row, but that's more complex.

Alternatively, since the reduction is along the last dimension, perhaps each block can process a group of elements in the last dimension. But since the last dimension is N, and each row is of length N, maybe each block is responsible for a single row. So, for each row, the block processes all N elements in that row.

But then, how to handle the reduction. For each row, the maximum is computed. So, the kernel would iterate over each row, and for each row, compute the max of its elements.

But how to structure the threads. Let me think about the thread index. Each thread in the block can be responsible for a particular element in the row. But since the reduction is over the entire row, the threads need to compare their elements and find the maximum.

Alternatively, maybe the block can process multiple elements in the row, but that might complicate the reduction. For example, using a parallel reduction within the block. But since the last dimension is N, and the rows are of length N, perhaps each block is responsible for a single row, and the threads in the block process the elements of that row.

Wait, but if the block size is larger than N, then each block would process multiple rows. Hmm, perhaps I need to think about how to split the rows into blocks. Let's say that each block is responsible for a single row. Then, the number of blocks would be M, and each block processes N elements. But for a 2D tensor, the rows are M in number, each of N elements.

But how to structure the threads. Let me think: each thread in the block would process a single element in the row. Then, the block would need to compute the max of all elements in that row. But how to do that with threads in the block.

Alternatively, maybe the block is responsible for a range of elements in the last dimension. For example, if the block size is BLOCK_SIZE, then each block handles a certain number of elements in the last dimension. But since the reduction is along the last dimension, perhaps each block processes a group of elements in the last dimension, but that's not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is designed such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. Then, for each row, the threads in the block compare their elements and compute the maximum. But this would require that each thread in the block has a unique index in the row.

Wait, maybe the kernel is structured as follows:

- Each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. For example, for a row i, the thread index j in the block corresponds to the element j in the row. Then, the block computes the max of all elements in that row.

But how to do that. For example, if the block has multiple threads, each thread would have a position in the row. Then, the threads can compare their values and pass the maximum up.

But this is similar to a parallel reduction. However, in this case, each thread is processing a single element in the row, and the block needs to compute the max of all those elements.

So, the steps would be:

1. For each row i in the input tensor,

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the maximum value). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the max of N elements.

Now, considering how Triton works, I need to structure the kernel to process these elements efficiently. Let me recall that Triton kernels are written in a way that uses thread blocks to process data in parallel. Each thread block will handle a certain number of rows, and each thread within the block will handle a certain number of elements in the row.

But wait, since we're reducing along the last dimension (N), each thread block should process a single row. Because for each row, we need to compute the maximum of N elements. However, if the number of elements per row (N) is large, we need to process them in a way that's efficient for the GPU.

So, the approach is to have each thread block handle one row. Then, within the block, we can have multiple threads working on different elements of that row. But how to organize that?

Alternatively, maybe each thread block can handle multiple rows, but that might complicate the reduction. Let me think. For a 2D tensor [M, N], each row has N elements. To compute the max of each row, each row can be processed by a thread block. But if M is large, that could be a lot of blocks. However, the key is to process each row efficiently.

Wait, but if each thread block processes one row, then each thread block has to process N elements. But if N is large, say 1024, then each thread block would have 1024 elements. How many threads per block would that require? Let's say each thread handles one element. Then, for a row of N elements, we need N threads per block. But if N is large, that might not be efficient because each block can have a maximum of 1024 threads (assuming 1024 is the maximum per block). So if N is larger than 1024, then we need multiple threads per block to process the elements of a row.

Wait, but in Triton, the number of threads per block is determined by the BLOCK_SIZE. So, perhaps the kernel should be designed with a block size that can handle the elements of a row. For example, if the row has N elements, then we can have multiple threads per block, each handling a subset of the elements. But how to do the reduction across those elements.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel should process each row in a way that uses a reduction across the elements of the row. For example, each thread block processes a row, and within the block, the threads perform a reduction to find the max.

So, for each row, the threads in the block will compute the max. Let me think about the steps:

1. Each thread block is responsible for processing one row (i.e., for a particular row index i).
2. Within the block, the threads will process the elements of that row (columns 0 to N-1).
3. The threads will perform a reduction to find the maximum value in that row.

But how to structure the threads in the block. Let's say the block has a certain number of threads, say BLOCK_SIZE. For a row of N elements, each thread can handle a chunk of elements. However, the reduction needs to be done in a way that all threads contribute to the final max.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, the number of threads per block should be such that each thread can process a portion of the elements. For example, if the row has N elements, and the block has K threads, then each thread can process N/K elements. But then, the reduction would need to be done across those chunks.

Alternatively, perhaps the block is designed to handle the reduction in a standard way. For example, using a standard reduction pattern where threads work in a way that each thread takes a portion of the data and reduces it.

But for a row of N elements, the number of threads per block would be determined by the block size. Let's say we have a block size of 1024. Then, for each row, the block will have 1024 threads. But if the row has N elements, then each thread can take a portion of the elements. However, if N is smaller than the block size, then some threads will be idle. But that's okay.

But how to handle that. Let's think of the kernel as follows:

Each thread block is assigned a row index i. Then, within the block, the threads are responsible for processing the elements of

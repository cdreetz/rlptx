Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through how to approach this.

First, the problem is to find the minimum value in each row of a 2D tensor. So for each row (each M element), we need to find the minimum among the N elements in that row. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Now, considering how Triton works, I need to structure the kernel to process each row. Let me recall that Triton kernels use a grid of threads, each processing a block. For this problem, each thread can handle one row. So the number of threads per block should be equal to the number of rows, M. But wait, Triton's block size is usually a power of two, so maybe I should use a block size that's a power of two, but that depends on M. Alternatively, I can use a dynamic block size based on M.

Wait, but for a 2D tensor, each row is of length N. So each thread needs to process all elements in a row. But if I have multiple threads per block, each thread could process a part of the row. However, since the reduction is along the row, each thread needs to compare elements and find the minimum.

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single row. So for each row, the thread processes all elements in that row, finds the minimum, and stores it in the output. But how to handle that in Triton.

Let me think about the steps:

1. The input tensor is [M, N], and the output is [M].

2. Each thread should process one row. So the number of threads in the grid should be M. But in Triton, the grid is determined by the number of blocks and threads per block. So if I have a block size of 1, then each thread handles one row. But that's not efficient. However, for a 2D tensor, maybe each thread can handle one row, and the block size is 1. But that's not optimal. Alternatively, maybe the block size can be set to a power of two, and the threads in the block can process different parts of the row.

Wait, but for a reduction along the row, the standard approach is to use a reduction kernel where each thread processes a part of the array and combines results. However, in this case, since the reduction is along the row, each thread needs to process all elements in the row. But that's not efficient if we have multiple threads per block. Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then we perform a reduction across the threads in the block.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, if we have multiple threads per block, each thread can process a subset of the elements. For example, if the block size is 16, then each thread can process 16 elements. But that's not correct because the reduction is across all elements in the row. So maybe the standard approach is to have each thread process a single element, and then perform a reduction across all threads in the block.

But in that case, the number of threads per block would be N, which could be large. But for a 2D tensor, N could be up to a large number, so maybe that's not feasible. Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is designed such that each thread is responsible for a single row, and then the thread processes all elements in that row, finding the minimum.

So for each row, the thread would iterate over all N elements in that row, compare them, and keep track of the minimum. Then, store the minimum in the output.

But how to implement that in Triton. Let's think about the memory layout. The input tensor is 2D, with shape [M, N]. So each row is a contiguous block of N elements. The output is a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

In Triton, the kernel will have to process each row. Let's assume that the kernel is launched with a grid of M threads, each thread handling one row. But in Triton, the grid is determined by the number of blocks and threads per block. So if we have a block size of 1, then each thread is responsible for one row. But that's not efficient. However, for the purposes of this problem, maybe that's manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single row, and the block size is 1. But then, for each row, the thread has to process all N elements in that row. So for each row, the thread would load each element, compare it with the current minimum, and update the minimum.

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is to find the minimum value in each row of the tensor. Since the tensor is 2D, each row is a vector of length N. The reduction is along the last dimension, which means for each row (each M), I need to find the minimum of the N elements.

So the input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Now, thinking about how to implement this in Triton. Triton kernels are written in a way that's similar to CUDA kernels, with threads processing elements in a grid. The key is to figure out how to partition the work across threads and handle the reduction properly.

First, I need to determine the grid and block sizes. Since each row is processed independently, I can have each thread handle a single element in the row. But since we need to find the minimum, each thread would need to compare its element with others in the same row.

Wait, but for a reduction, a common approach is to use a warp-level reduction. So for each row, we can have multiple threads working on the elements, and then combine their results.

But how to structure this. Let's think about the data layout. The input tensor is [M, N], so each row is M elements. For each row, we need to compute the minimum of N elements.

So for each row, we can have a group of threads that process that row. The number of threads per row would depend on the number of elements in the row (N). But since N can vary, we need to handle that.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a grid and block size. Let's decide on the block size. Let's say we use a block size of 128, which is a common choice for warp sizes. But for each row, the number of elements is N, so the number of threads per row would be the number of elements in the row. However, if N is not a multiple of the block size, we need to handle that.

Alternatively, for each row, we can have a number of threads equal to the number of elements in the row. But since the kernel is written in a way that each thread has a unique index, perhaps we can use a loop over the elements in the row.

Wait, maybe the approach is to have each thread process a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction across all threads in the warp. But how to handle that.

Alternatively, for each row, the threads can be assigned to process elements in the row. For example, if there are N elements in a row, then each thread is responsible for a single element. Then, the threads in the warp can perform a reduction to find the minimum.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let's think about the kernel parameters. The input tensor is a 2D tensor, and the output is a 1D tensor of size M.

So the kernel would have to process each row. Let's think about the grid. The grid size would be M, with each block handling one row. But since each row has N elements, the block size would need to be at least N. However, if N is large, this could be inefficient.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a block size that is a power of two, and for each row, the threads in the block process the elements in the row. For example, if the block size is 128, then for each row, the threads would process elements in the row, and then perform a reduction.

But how to handle rows where N is not a multiple of the block size. For example, if N is 100, and block size is 128, then the first 100 elements would be processed, but the remaining 28 threads would be idle. That's acceptable, but we need to make sure that the reduction is done properly.

Alternatively, for each row, we can have a number of threads equal to N, and then perform a reduction across all threads. But for that, each thread would have to process one element, and then the threads in the warp would combine their results.

So the kernel would have a grid of M blocks, each block handling one row. Each block would process the elements in that row. The block size would be determined by the number of elements in the row. But since the row size can vary, perhaps we can use a dynamic block size, but in Triton, the block size is fixed.

Wait, in Triton, the kernel is written with a fixed block size. So the block size is chosen based on the expected number of elements per row

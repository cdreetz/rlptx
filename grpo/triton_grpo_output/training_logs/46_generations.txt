Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is to calculate the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. So for each row (each M element), I need to sum all the elements in that row and then divide by N. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M].

Let me consider the GPU operations. Triton kernels are written in a way that's efficient for parallel processing. Each thread will handle a specific row. So, I need to figure out how to process each row.

The input tensor is 2D, with shape [M, N]. The output is [M]. So, for each row i, sum all elements in column 0 to N-1, then divide by N.

Now, the kernel needs to process each row. Let's think about the thread index. Each thread will handle one row. So, the thread index in the first dimension (M) will be the row index. The second dimension (N) is the column index.

But how to structure the kernel? The kernel will have a loop over the columns for each row. So, for each row i, the thread will iterate over all columns j from 0 to N-1, sum the elements, then divide by N.

But wait, in Triton, the kernel is written with a grid and a block. The grid size is determined by the number of rows M. Each block will process one row. So, the number of blocks is M, and each block has one thread. But maybe that's not efficient. Alternatively, maybe using a block size that can handle multiple rows? Wait, no. Since each row is independent, each thread can handle one row. So, the grid size is M, and each block has one thread. But in Triton, the block size is usually a power of two. However, for this problem, since each row is independent, maybe it's better to have each thread process one row. So, the grid is M, and each block has one thread. But that might not be efficient for very large M. Alternatively, maybe using a larger block size and having multiple threads per block, but that would complicate things. But given that each row is independent, perhaps it's better to have each thread handle one row.

So, the kernel will have a loop over the rows. For each row, the thread will loop over the columns, sum them up.

But how to handle the memory access? The input tensor is a 2D tensor. So, for each row i, the elements are at positions (i, j) for j from 0 to N-1.

In Triton, the kernel will have to load these elements. So, for each row i, the thread will load the elements in that row, sum them, then divide by N.

Now, the kernel needs to be written with the @triton.jit decorator. The parameters would be the input tensor, the output tensor, and the dimensions M and N.

But wait, the input tensor is [M, N], and the output is [M]. So, the kernel will have to compute for each row i, the sum of the elements in that row.

So, the steps for the kernel:

1. For each row i in 0 to M-1:
   a. Sum all elements in row i (columns 0 to N-1)
   b. Divide the sum by N to get the mean for that row.

Now, in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows. Each thread will handle one row. So, the thread index is i. Then, for each row, the thread will loop over the columns j from 0 to N-1, summing the values.

But how to handle the memory access? The input tensor is stored as a 2D array. So, for row i, column j, the index is i * N + j. But in Triton, when you have a 2D tensor, you can access it as input[i, j], but the actual memory layout depends on how the tensor is stored. However, in Triton, when you pass the tensor to the kernel, you have to specify the strides. So, the kernel will need to know the strides of the input tensor. Alternatively, the kernel can be written with the correct indexing.

But perhaps the kernel will be written with the input as a 1D tensor, and the row and column indices are calculated. Wait, maybe the input is a 1D tensor, and the kernel is written with the row and column indices. For example, if the input is a 1D tensor of size M*N, then for row i and column j, the index is i*N + j. But in the problem, the input is a

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to compute the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. So for each row (each M element), I need to sum all the elements in that row and then divide by N. But since Triton is a GPU programming language, I need to structure this in a way that's efficient on the GPU.

Input and output shapes: The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

Memory layout: The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. For each row, I need to process all N elements. The output will be a single value per row.

Optimal block sizes: Since we're processing rows, each block can handle one row. But since each row has N elements, the block size should be chosen such that each thread processes one element in the row. However, if N is large, maybe we can have multiple threads per row. Wait, but for a 2D tensor, each row has N elements. So for each row, we can have multiple threads processing each element. Alternatively, since the output is per row, maybe each thread can handle one element in the row, and then the sum is computed across threads in the block. But how to structure this?

Wait, the standard approach for reduction is to have each thread process a single element, then perform a reduction. But here, since we need to sum all elements in a row, and then divide by N. So for each row, the sum is the sum of all N elements. So for each row, we can have a block of threads that compute the sum of that row.

But how to structure the blocks. Let's think: Each block can handle one row. So for each row, we have a block of threads. The number of threads per block would be N, but that might be too large. Alternatively, we can have a block size that is a power of two, and each thread processes a chunk of elements. But maybe for simplicity, we can have each thread process one element in the row, and then the threads in the block sum their values.

But the problem is that for each row, the number of elements is N. So if we have a block size of, say, 128, then each block can handle up to 128 elements. But if N is larger than 128, then we need multiple blocks per row. Wait, but each row is processed by a separate block. So perhaps each block is responsible for a single row. Then, the number of threads per block is N. But that's not efficient if N is large. Alternatively, we can have each block process multiple rows, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe we can structure it so that each thread processes a single element in the row, and then the threads in the block sum their values. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block can handle up to 128 elements in a row. But that would require that each row has enough elements to fill the block. However, if N is not a multiple of the block size, then we need to handle the remainder.

But perhaps the better approach is to have each block handle one row. So for each row, the block processes all N elements. But how to do that in Triton.

Alternatively, think of it as a 2D grid where each row is processed by a block. For example, the grid has M blocks (one per row), and each block has N threads (one per element in the row). But that's not efficient for large N. However, if N is large, then each block would have a lot of threads. But Triton allows for dynamic thread counts, so maybe that's manageable.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a more efficient approach where each block handles a row, and the threads in the block perform a reduction to sum the row. For example, if the block has 128 threads, then each thread can process a chunk of elements in the row. But this requires that the number of elements in the row is divisible by the block size, which may not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard approach for reduction is to use a warp-level reduction. So for each row, the threads in the block perform a reduction to sum the row. So for each row, the block has a certain number of threads, and they reduce the sum of the row.

But how to structure this. Let's think about the steps.

First, the kernel needs to process each row. For each row, we need to sum all N elements. Then

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the minimum value in each row of a 2D tensor. Since the tensor is [M, N], each row has N elements, and we want the min of each row. So for each row (i.e., each row index m), we need to find the minimum among the N elements in that row.

Now, considering how Triton kernels work. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA, but with more high-level abstractions. The kernel will process elements in blocks, and each block will handle a certain number of elements.

First, I need to figure out the memory layout. The input tensor is 2D, so it's stored as a contiguous array in memory. For a 2D tensor with shape [M, N], the element at row m, column n is located at index m*N + n. But in Triton, when we access the tensor, we can use the row and column indices.

Next, the kernel needs to process each row. So, for each row m, we need to iterate over all columns n from 0 to N-1. But how to structure the blocks? Since each row is processed independently, perhaps each block can handle a single row. However, that might not be efficient if N is large. Alternatively, maybe each block can process multiple elements in a row, but since the reduction is per row, perhaps each block can handle a single row.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is launched with a certain number of threads per block. So, if we have M rows, and each block processes a row, then the number of blocks would be M. But for each row, the number of threads per block would be N. However, that might not be efficient because if N is large, the number of threads per block could be too big. Alternatively, maybe we can have each block process a certain number of elements in a row, but since the reduction is per row, perhaps the block needs to process all elements in a row.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a more efficient approach where each block processes a certain number of elements in the row, and then reduces them. But since the reduction is per row, perhaps the block can handle all elements in a row. However, for a row with N elements, if N is large, the number of threads per block would be N. But Triton's block size is usually a power of two, so maybe we can set the block size to a value that divides N or something.

Wait, but the problem is that for each row, we need to find the minimum. So for each row, we can have a thread per element, but that's not efficient. Alternatively, we can use a reduction approach where threads in the block work together to find the minimum.

So, the approach would be: for each row, we have a block of threads that process the elements in that row. The block will perform a reduction to find the minimum. But how to structure that.

Let me think. For each row m, the elements are in the row m, columns 0 to N-1. So, for each row, the kernel needs to process all N elements. The block can be responsible for processing one row. So, the number of blocks would be M, and each block processes a row. But how many threads per block? Well, for each row, we can have a number of threads equal to the number of elements in the row. But if N is large, that's not efficient. So perhaps we can use a block size that's a power of two, and then use a reduction within the block.

Alternatively, maybe the block can process multiple elements in a row, but that might complicate the reduction.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then the block reduces all those elements to find the minimum. But that would require that each thread in the block processes one element, and then the block does a reduction.

But for that, the number of threads per block would be N, which could be large. However, Triton allows for dynamic block sizes. But perhaps for better efficiency, we can set the block size to a value that's a power of two, and then use a reduction within the block.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, the number of threads per block would be the number of elements in the row. So, for example, if N is 1024, then each block would have 1024 threads. But that's possible in Triton.

But perhaps a better approach is to have each block process a certain number of elements in the row, and then perform a reduction. For example

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the min reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the minimum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor). So for each row (each M element), I need to find the minimum of the N elements in that row.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Memory layout: The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. The output tensor will be a 1D array where each element corresponds to a row's minimum.

Optimal block sizes and memory access patterns. Since we're processing each row independently, I can have each thread handle a single row. But maybe it's more efficient to have threads work on elements within a row. Wait, but for a min reduction, each thread would need to compare elements in the row. However, since the rows are independent, perhaps each thread can handle a single element in the row, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, using a block size that allows for parallel reduction within each row.

Wait, for each row, we need to compute the minimum. So for a row of N elements, we can have multiple threads working on that row. The number of threads per row would depend on the block size. Let's think about how to structure this.

Let me consider the block size. For each row, the number of elements is N. Let's say each thread handles a portion of the row. But since we need to compute the min, we can use a reduction pattern. However, since each row is processed independently, maybe we can have each thread handle a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction across the threads in the block.

Alternatively, for each row, we can have a block of threads that process that row. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block can handle a row of N elements, but that depends on N. But if N is large, say 1024, then a block of 128 threads can process 128 elements in the row, and then perform a reduction to find the minimum.

But since the rows are independent, maybe each thread can handle a single element in the row, and then the threads in the block can reduce their results. However, this approach would require that each thread has access to the elements in the row. So, for a row, the threads would process elements in that row, and then the block would compute the minimum of all those elements.

So the plan is: for each row, we have a group of threads that process the elements in that row. The threads in the block work together to find the minimum of the row.

Now, how to structure the kernel. The kernel will have to iterate over each row, and for each row, process the elements. Let's think about the indices. For each row i, the elements are from column 0 to N-1.

So, the kernel will have a loop over rows. For each row, the threads in the block will process elements in that row. The number of threads per row depends on the block size. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block handles a row, and the threads in the block process elements in that row.

Wait, but if the block size is 128, then for a row with N elements, the threads in the block would process elements in that row. However, if N is not a multiple of the block size, then some threads might process elements beyond the row's length, which would need to be handled with masking.

Alternatively, we can have each thread handle a single element in the row. Then, the threads in the block can perform a reduction to find the minimum. But this requires that each thread has access to the element in the row. So for a row, the threads would be assigned to different elements in the row.

But how to structure the kernel. Let's think about the parameters. The kernel will take the input tensor, the output tensor, the dimensions M and N, and the block size.

The kernel will have a loop over rows. For each row, the threads in the block will process elements in that row. Let's say that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. Then, the threads in the block can perform a reduction to find the minimum.

But how to assign the elements to threads. For a given row i, the elements are at positions (i, 0), (i, 1), ..., (i, N-1). So for a given row, the threads

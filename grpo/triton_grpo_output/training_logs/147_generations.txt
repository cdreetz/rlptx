Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in the context of GPU kernels, especially with Triton.

First, the matrices are A (M x K) and B (K x N). The result is a matrix C (M x N), where each element C[i][j] is the dot product of the i-th row of A and the j-th column of B. But doing this naively would be too slow, so we need to use tile-based computation to optimize memory access and utilize shared memory.

In Triton, shared memory is used to store tiles of the matrices, which allows for coalesced memory access. The key is to partition the matrices into blocks (tiles) that fit into shared memory. The block size is usually a multiple of the warp size, so maybe 32 or 64 elements per block. Let's choose 32 as a common block size.

Each thread in the kernel will handle a block of elements. For matrix multiplication, each thread might compute a portion of the result. But how to structure this? Typically, each thread is responsible for a block of the output matrix. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of tiles. Let me recall that in matrix multiplication, we can split the matrices into tiles. For example, if the block size is 32, then each tile of A is 32x32, and similarly for B. But since A is M x K and B is K x N, the tiles would be arranged such that each thread computes a part of the result.

Wait, maybe I need to use a more standard approach. Let me think: for each element in the output matrix C, the computation is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. To compute this efficiently, we can split the computation into tiles. Each thread will compute a portion of the sum. But how to do that with shared memory?

In the standard approach, each thread is responsible for a block of the output matrix. For example, each thread computes a block of size (block_size x block_size) in the output matrix. But since the matrices A and B are of sizes M x K and K x N, the block size needs to be chosen such that the tiles fit into shared memory. Let me think about the shared memory layout.

Let me assume that the block size is 32. So, each thread will handle a block of size 32x32 in the output matrix. However, the actual computation requires that each thread computes a part of the dot product. Wait, maybe I should structure the kernel so that each thread is responsible for computing a single element of the output matrix. But that would be too slow. Instead, we need to compute multiple elements in parallel.

Alternatively, the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton uses a tile-based approach where each thread block computes a tile of the output matrix. Each thread in the block computes a part of the tile. For example, each thread computes a single element of the output matrix. But this would require that the threads can access the necessary elements of A and B from shared memory.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to split the matrices into tiles. Let me think again. The matrices A and B are stored in global memory. Each thread block will load a tile of A and a tile of B into shared memory. Then, the threads in the block compute the product of these tiles. But how to structure this?

Let me think of the matrices as being split into tiles of size (block_size, block_size). For example, the matrix A is split into tiles of size (block_size, block_size), and similarly for B. Then, each thread block computes a tile of the output matrix C. However, since the matrices are of sizes M x K and K x N, the tile sizes need to be compatible.

Wait, perhaps the key is to have each thread compute a portion of the dot product. For example, each thread is responsible for computing a single element of the output matrix. But to do this efficiently, we need to load the necessary elements of A and B into shared memory. However, this would require that the threads can access the elements in a coalesced manner.

Alternatively, the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to use a block size of 32, and each thread is responsible for computing a single element of the output matrix. But this would require that each thread loads the corresponding elements of A and B from global memory into shared memory, and then compute the dot product. However, this would be too slow because each thread would have to load individual elements, leading to poor memory access.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to use a tile-based approach where each thread block computes a tile of the output matrix. Each tile

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The user wants tile-based computation using shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in Triton.

First, the matrices are A (MxK) and B (KxN). The result C will be MxN. Each element C[i,j] is the sum of A[i,k] * B[k,j] for k from 0 to K-1. But with tile-based computation, I need to break this down into smaller tiles to optimize memory access.

Triton kernels use shared memory to reduce global memory access. So, I should load chunks of A and B into shared memory. The key is to compute the product in tiles, where each tile is a block of rows from A and columns from B.

Let me think about the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 is common. Let's say I use 32 elements per block. But I need to make sure that the tiles fit into the shared memory. The shared memory size depends on the block size and the number of elements per tile.

For each thread, I need to compute a portion of the result. The threads will be organized into blocks. Each block will handle a tile of A and B. The threads in the block will compute the dot product of a row from A and a column from B.

Wait, but in matrix multiplication, each thread might compute a single element of C. However, with tile-based computation, threads might work on smaller tiles. Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a block of elements. Hmm, maybe I should structure the kernel such that each thread block handles a tile of A and B, and computes a tile of C.

But how to split the matrices into tiles. Let's say the tile size is T. For example, if T is 32, then each tile is 32x32 elements. But the actual tile size depends on the block size. Wait, in Triton, each thread block has a certain number of threads. For example, if I have a block size of 32, then each thread block can handle a certain number of rows and columns.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread block computes a tile of C. Let me think. The standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to use shared memory for A and B, and compute the dot product for each element of C.

But since the user wants tile-based computation, perhaps the kernel is divided into tiles. For example, each thread block handles a tile of A and B, and computes a tile of C. However, the exact details depend on the block size and how the threads are arranged.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the tile size. Let's say the tile size is 32x32. So each tile of A is 32 rows by 32 columns, and each tile of B is 32 columns by 32 rows. Then, each thread block can handle a tile of A and B, and compute a tile of C.

But for the kernel, each thread would be responsible for a single element of C. However, with tile-based computation, the threads might work on a block of elements. Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread block processes a block of rows from A and columns from B.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread block compute a block of rows from A and columns from B. For example, each thread block processes a block of K elements (the inner dimension) for the matrix multiplication. But that might not be the case here.

Alternatively, the kernel could be structured as follows:

- Each thread block handles a tile of A (say, of size T x T) and a tile of B (T x T), and computes a tile of C (T x T).

But the exact way to split the matrices into tiles depends on the block size. Let me think about the memory layout.

The input tensors A and B are stored in global memory. The kernel will load chunks of A and B into shared memory. For each thread, it will compute a single element of C. However, with tile-based computation, the threads will process multiple elements in a block.

Wait, maybe I should use the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton. Let me recall that in Triton, each thread block is responsible for computing a single element of C. But that's not efficient. Instead, the kernel is structured to compute a block of elements in a way that uses shared memory for efficient access.

Alternatively, the kernel is structured such that each thread block handles a tile of A and B, and computes a tile of C. Let me think about the parameters.

The matrices A (M x K) and B (K x N) are multiplied. The result is C

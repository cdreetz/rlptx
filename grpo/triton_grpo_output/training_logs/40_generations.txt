Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the maximum value in that row). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the max of N elements.

Now, considering how Triton works, I need to structure the kernel to process each row. Each thread will handle a specific row. But since we're doing a reduction, we need to use a reduction pattern. However, since the reduction is along the last dimension, each row is independent. Wait, noâ€”each row is a separate reduction. So for each row, we need to find the maximum of all elements in that row.

So, the kernel should process each row. Let's think about the input tensor. Let's say the input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N], and the output is a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the max of the corresponding row.

In Triton, the kernel will be launched with a certain number of blocks. Since each row is processed independently, each block can handle one row. But how to structure this?

Wait, maybe each thread in a block handles a single element in the row. But for reduction, we need to collect all elements in the row and find the maximum. So, perhaps each thread is responsible for a particular element in the row, and then we perform a reduction across the threads in the block.

But for a row of N elements, if we have a block with, say, 128 threads, then each thread can process a portion of the row. But how to handle the reduction across the threads.

Alternatively, since each row is independent, we can process each row in parallel. So for each row, we can have a reduction across the elements in that row.

So, the kernel will have to iterate over each row, and for each row, perform a reduction across the N elements. But how to structure this in Triton.

Let me think about the steps:

1. Determine the number of rows (M) and columns (N). The kernel will need to process each row.

2. For each row, we need to find the maximum value among the N elements in that row.

3. Each thread in a block can handle a part of the row. For example, if the block has 128 threads, and the row has N elements, then each thread can handle a chunk of elements. But for reduction, we need to collect all elements in the row and find the maximum.

But how to do this in Triton. Let's think of the kernel as processing each row. So, the kernel will have to loop over each row, and for each row, perform a reduction.

But in Triton, the kernel is launched with a certain number of blocks. Let's say we have M rows, and each block processes one row. But if M is large, we need to have enough blocks. However, for each row, we need to process N elements. So, the kernel's loop would be over the rows, and for each row, process the elements.

But how to structure the threads. Let's say each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. Then, for each row, we can have multiple threads working on different elements, and then perform a reduction across the threads.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that for each row, we have a reduction across the elements. So, the kernel will have to process each row, and for each row, perform a reduction.

But how to do that in Triton. Let me think of the kernel's parameters. The input tensor is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N], and the output is a 1D tensor of shape [M].

So, in the kernel, each thread will process a specific row. But for each row, the threads need to process the elements in that row and find the maximum.

Wait, perhaps the kernel is structured with a loop over the rows. For each row, the threads in the block process the elements of that row. For example, if the block has 128 threads, and the row has N elements, then each thread can process a chunk of elements. But for a reduction, we need to collect all elements in the row.

But how to handle this. Maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. Then, for each row, the threads perform a reduction across all elements in that row.

But for that, the kernel would need to loop over each row, and for each row, loop over each element in the row, and perform a reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row,

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the maximum element). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the max of N elements.

Now, considering GPU operations. Triton kernels are written in a way that's efficient for parallel processing. So I need to figure out how to structure the kernel to process each row efficiently.

Input and output tensors: The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the max of the corresponding row.

Memory layout: The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. For each row, we need to process all N elements. The output tensor will have one element per row.

Block size: I need to choose a block size that's efficient. Typically, for such reductions, a block size of 256 is common, but maybe 128 or 256 depends on the problem. Let's think about how many elements each thread can process. Since each thread can handle a portion of the row, maybe we can have each thread process a single element, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread process a chunk of elements, but since the max is a reduction, perhaps it's better to have each thread process a single element and then reduce across threads.

Wait, for a max reduction, each thread can take care of a subset of the elements and then combine with others. But for a row, the max is computed across all N elements. So for each row, we need to compute the max of N elements. So for each row, the threads in the block can work together to compute the max.

So, for each row, the block will process all N elements. But how to structure this. Let's think about the threads per block. For example, if the block size is 256, then each block can process a row if N is larger than 256. But if N is smaller than 256, then the threads can process the elements in the row.

But since the kernel is for a 2D tensor, each thread will process a single element in the row. Wait, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then they perform a reduction across the threads to find the max.

Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread process a chunk of elements and then combine. But for a max reduction, the order of operations doesn't matter as long as all elements are considered.

So the approach would be: for each row, each thread is responsible for a single element, and then they perform a reduction across the threads to find the max.

But how to handle this in Triton. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The kernel will process each row. So for each row, the threads in the block will process the elements in that row.

So, the kernel will have a loop over the rows. For each row, the threads will process the elements in that row. But how to structure the threads per row.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread is assigned a row and a position within the row. But that might not be efficient. Let's think about the kernel's parameters.

The input tensor is [M, N], and the output is [M]. So for each row i in 0..M-1, compute max of input[i, 0..N-1].

So the kernel will have to iterate over each row, and for each row, process all N elements.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows. For each row, the threads in the block will process the elements in that row.

So, the kernel will have a loop over the rows. For each row, the threads in the block will process the elements in that row. For example, if there are 256 threads per block, then for each row, each thread can process a single element, and then they perform a reduction to find the max.

But how to handle the threads per row. Let's think about the block size. Let's say we have a block size of 256. For each row, the threads in the block will process the elements in that row. So, for a row with N elements, each thread is responsible for a single element, and then they reduce across the threads to find the max.

But how to handle when N is not a multiple of the block size. For example, if N is 512, and block size is 256, then each block can process 2

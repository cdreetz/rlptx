Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. So, the input is a 2D tensor, and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row in the input.

First, I need to figure out what GPU operations are needed. Since we're dealing with a reduction along the last dimension, each row (of length N) needs to be summed and then divided by N. So, for each row, sum all elements and then divide by N.

Next, the input and output shapes. The input is [M, N], and the output is [M]. So, the kernel needs to process each row (M rows) and compute the mean for each.

Now, considering Triton's memory layout. The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. For each row, we need to load all N elements and sum them. Then, divide by N.

Block size: Since we're processing rows, each block can handle one row. But wait, in Triton, blocks are typically processed in a way that each thread handles a part of the data. However, for a row-wise reduction, maybe each thread can handle a single element in the row. But since we need to sum all elements in the row, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element, and then we reduce across threads in the block.

Wait, but for a row, there are N elements. So, if we have a block size of, say, 128 threads, each thread can handle a single element. Then, the block can sum all the elements in the row. But how to handle that?

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then the block reduces across threads to get the sum. Then, after summing, divide by N.

So, for each row, the threads in the block process each element in the row. Let's think about the block size. Let's say each block processes one row. So, the number of blocks would be M. Each block has a certain number of threads. For each row, the number of elements is N. So, the number of threads per block should be at least N. But if N is large, that might not be efficient. However, Triton allows for dynamic block sizes. Alternatively, perhaps we can use a block size that's a power of two, and handle the elements in the row with warp-level reductions.

But maybe the simplest approach is to have each thread handle one element in the row, and then the block reduces across threads to sum the row. Then, after summing, divide by N.

So, the steps would be:

For each row (i in 0 to M-1):

   sum = 0

   for each element in the row (j in 0 to N-1):

       sum += input[i][j]

   mean = sum / N

But how to implement this in Triton.

In Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows. Each thread is responsible for a particular row. Wait, no. Each thread can be assigned to a particular row and a particular element in the row. But perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is assigned to a particular row, and then processes all elements in that row. But that's not efficient because each thread would have to process N elements, which could be expensive.

Alternatively, maybe each block is responsible for a single row. So, the block's index determines which row it's handling. Then, within the block, the threads process the elements in that row.

But how to do that? Let's think about the grid and block dimensions.

The grid would have M blocks, each handling a row. Each block has a certain number of threads. For each block, the threads process the elements in the row. For example, if the block has 128 threads, and the row has N elements, then each thread would handle one element. But if N is larger than the number of threads, then we need to do a reduction across threads. Wait, but if each thread is handling one element, then the block can sum all the elements in the row by adding all the elements from each thread.

But how to do that? Let's say the block is responsible for row i. Then, each thread in the block is assigned a position j in the row. But how to assign that?

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured with a loop over the rows. For each row, the threads in the block process the elements of that row. So, the kernel would have:

@triton.jit
def kernel(input, output, N, M, ...):
    row_id = ... # get the row index from the thread index
    # for each row, process

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to compute the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. Since the tensor is [M, N], each row has N elements, and we need to compute the average for each row. So for each row i, sum all elements in column 0 to N-1 and divide by N.

Now, considering GPU operations. Triton is a GPU programming language, so I need to use its primitives. The kernel will process each row. Each thread should handle one row. But wait, how to organize the threads? Maybe each thread is responsible for a single row. But since each row has N elements, the number of threads per row would be N. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can process each row in a way that each thread handles a single element, but that would require more threads. Hmm.

Wait, the standard approach for such reductions is to have each thread handle a single element, but for a reduction, we need to accumulate. However, in this case, since we need the sum of each row, maybe we can process each row by having multiple threads per row. But how to structure that.

Alternatively, think of the kernel as processing each row. Each thread is responsible for a single row. Then, for each row, the thread needs to sum all N elements. But how to do that efficiently.

But for a 2D tensor, each row is a contiguous block in memory. So if the tensor is stored in row-major order, each row is contiguous. So for a given row i, the elements are at positions i*N to i*N + N-1.

But in Triton, the kernel is written in a way that each thread is assigned a position in the tensor. So maybe the kernel will have a thread per element, but that's not efficient. Alternatively, we can have threads per row. Let me think.

Let me consider the input tensor as a 2D array with shape [M, N]. The output is a 1D array of size M, where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

So, the kernel needs to compute for each row i, the sum of elements from column 0 to N-1, then divide by N.

So, the steps are:

1. For each row i in 0 to M-1:
   a. Sum all elements in row i.
   b. Divide the sum by N to get the mean.

Now, how to implement this in Triton.

First, the kernel needs to process each row. Let's think about the thread index. If we have M rows, and each row has N elements, then the total number of elements is M*N. But for a kernel, we can have multiple threads processing different elements.

But in this case, since we need to process each row, maybe the kernel should have a thread per row. But if N is large, then each row has N elements, so each thread would need to process N elements. That could be inefficient. Alternatively, perhaps we can have threads that process elements in a way that allows for efficient memory access.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. So maybe the kernel is structured with a loop over the elements, but with some way to group them.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel can be structured with a loop over the rows, and for each row, process all elements in that row. But how to do that in Triton.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensor is 2D, with shape [M, N]. Let's assume that the tensor is stored in row-major order. So, for row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j, where j ranges from 0 to N-1.

In Triton, the kernel will have a loop over the elements. But since we need to process each row, perhaps the kernel can be structured with a loop over the rows, and for each row, process all elements in that row.

But how to structure that in Triton. Let's think of the kernel as having a loop over the rows, and for each row, a loop over the columns. But that would be O(M*N) operations, which is acceptable.

But for a Triton kernel, the code is written in a way that each thread processes a single element. However, for this problem, each row has N elements, so if we have M rows, then the total number of elements is M*N. So, the kernel would need to process each element once.

But perhaps we can have each thread process a single element. Then, for each element, we can accumulate the sum for its row. But that would require that each thread knows which row it belongs to.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel can

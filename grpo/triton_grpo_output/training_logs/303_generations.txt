Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the min reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let's break this down step by step.

First, understanding the problem: The input is a 2D tensor with dimensions M (rows) and N (columns). The task is to compute the minimum value along the last dimension, which means for each row (since the last dimension is N), we need to find the minimum of all elements in that row. So the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row in the input.

Next, thinking about GPU operations. Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for parallelism. Each thread will handle a specific row. Since we're reducing along the last dimension (columns), each thread will process one row. For each row, we need to find the minimum value across all N elements.

Now, input and output tensor shapes. The input is [M, N], and the output is [M]. The output tensor will have one element per row of the input.

Optimal block sizes and memory access patterns. Since each thread is handling a row, the block size should be such that each thread can process a row. However, since each row has N elements, and the number of threads per block can vary, but typically, for such reductions, a block size of 1 or 256 might be used. However, since each row is processed independently, perhaps each thread can handle a single row. Wait, but if the number of rows is M, then the number of threads needed is M. So, the kernel should launch M threads, each processing one row.

But wait, in Triton, the kernel is launched with a certain number of threads per block and blocks. So, for example, if we have M rows, and each thread processes one row, then the number of threads per block would be determined by the number of rows. But if M is large, we need to launch multiple blocks. However, for this problem, since each row is independent, we can have each thread handle a single row. So, the kernel should be structured so that each thread processes one row.

But how to handle the memory access? For each row, the thread needs to load all N elements from that row, then compute the minimum. So, for each row, the thread will iterate over the columns (from 0 to N-1) and find the minimum.

But wait, that's O(M*N) operations, which might not be optimal. However, since each row is processed independently, perhaps we can optimize by having each thread process a row, and for each row, the thread can load the elements and compute the minimum.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The input tensor is a 2D tensor, so in Triton, we can pass it as a pointer, and the kernel will have to access it with row and column indices.

So, the kernel will have to iterate over each row (i) and for each row, iterate over each column (j) to find the minimum. But that's a nested loop, which might not be efficient. Alternatively, perhaps we can use a more optimized approach where each thread processes a row, and for that row, we can find the minimum by loading all elements and then comparing them.

But for a row of N elements, the minimum can be found by initializing the minimum to the first element, then comparing with each subsequent element. However, for N elements, this would take N operations per row. But if N is large, this could be slow. However, since the kernel is written in Triton, which is optimized for parallelism, perhaps this is acceptable.

So, the steps for the kernel would be:

1. For each row i in 0 to M-1:
   a. Load the elements of row i from the input tensor.
   b. Find the minimum value in that row.
   c. Store the minimum value in the output tensor at position i.

Now, the kernel needs to be structured in a way that each thread handles one row. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The kernel will need to know the number of rows (M) and columns (N), as well as the input and output tensors.

In Triton, the kernel is written with a function that has parameters for the input and output tensors, along with the dimensions. The kernel will be launched with a certain number of threads per block and blocks. For example, if we have M rows, then the number of threads per block can be set to a value that divides M, but since each thread processes one row, perhaps the number of threads per block is 1, and the number of blocks is M. However, in practice, Triton's launch configuration is determined by the kernel's code.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the min reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the minimum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor). So for each row (each M element), I need to find the minimum of the N elements in that row.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels typically use a grid of blocks, each processing a portion of the data. For this problem, each block can handle a single row. But since each row has N elements, I need to make sure that each block can process all elements in a row. However, since N can be large, maybe it's better to have each thread handle one element in the row. Wait, but for a reduction, threads need to work together. Wait, no, because for each row, we need to find the minimum. So for each row, we can have multiple threads working on that row, and then combine their results.

But how to structure the threads. Let's think: for each row, we can have multiple threads processing elements in that row. For example, if we have a block size of 128, then each block can handle a row, and each thread in the block processes a portion of the row. But since the reduction is along the row, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element, and then they perform a reduction.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, the number of threads per block would need to be at least N. But if N is large, that's not feasible. So maybe the block size is determined by the number of elements per row. Alternatively, maybe we can use a dynamic block size based on the row length. But Triton requires that the kernel is written with a fixed block size. So perhaps we need to process each row with a block that has enough threads to handle the reduction.

Alternatively, for each row, we can have a reduction. So for each row, the threads in the block will compute the minimum. Let me think about how to structure this.

Each row is processed by a block. For each row, the block's threads will compute the minimum. So for a row of N elements, the number of threads per block would be determined by the number of elements. But since N can be arbitrary, maybe the block size is chosen as a power of two, and the threads in the block will process the elements in the row.

Wait, but the block size is fixed. So for each row, the block will have a certain number of threads, and each thread will process a portion of the row. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block can process a row of up to 128 elements. But if the row is longer than that, then multiple blocks would be needed. However, since the kernel is written for a single row, perhaps the block is responsible for processing a single row.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed such that each block processes a single row, and the threads within the block perform the reduction. So for each row, the block has multiple threads, each handling a subset of the elements in the row, and then combining their results.

But how to handle this in Triton. Let's think of the kernel as processing each row. For each row, the threads in the block will compute the minimum. So for a row of N elements, the number of threads per block is determined by the number of elements in the row. But since the block size is fixed, perhaps we can use a dynamic approach where the block size is chosen based on the row length.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is written with a fixed block size, and for each row, the threads in the block process the elements in that row. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block will handle a row of N elements, and the threads in the block will work together to compute the minimum. But if N is larger than the block size, then multiple threads per element would be needed, but that's not possible. So perhaps the kernel is designed for rows where N is a multiple of the block size. But that's not general.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then the threads perform a reduction. For example, if the row has N elements, then the number of threads per block is N. But that's not feasible for large N, as the block size is fixed. So maybe the block size is chosen as a power of two, and the threads

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the maximum element). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the max of N elements.

Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for GPU parallelism. So I need to structure the kernel to process elements in a way that maximizes memory access efficiency and utilizes warp-level parallelism.

Let me recall the steps for a Triton kernel:

1. Determine the GPU operations needed. Here, for each row, we need to compute the maximum of N elements. So, for each row, we'll process all N elements in that row.

2. Input and output shapes: The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output is a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the max of the corresponding row.

3. Memory layout: The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. The output tensor will be a 1D array where each element corresponds to a row's max.

4. Block sizes and memory access: Since each row is processed independently, each block can handle one row. However, since the number of rows (M) might not be divisible by the block count, we need to handle that. But for simplicity, maybe we can process each row in a separate thread, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, using a block per row, but that depends on the number of rows.

Wait, but Triton's threads are arranged in warps. So, perhaps a better approach is to have each thread process a single element in the row, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, we can have each thread handle a chunk of elements in the row, but that depends on the block size.

But for max reduction, the standard approach is to have each thread process a single element, and then perform a reduction. However, since we're doing a reduction along the last dimension (N), each row's elements need to be reduced. So for each row, we need to compute the max of N elements.

So, for each row, the kernel needs to process all N elements. So, perhaps each block is responsible for processing one row. Let me think about the block size. Let's say each block processes one row, and each thread in the block handles a single element in that row. But that might not be efficient because for a row of N elements, each thread would process one element, but the number of threads per block would be N. However, if N is large, that could be a problem. Alternatively, maybe we can process the row in a way that each thread handles a portion of the row, but that requires more complex logic.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a standard max reduction approach. For each row, we can compute the max by having threads in a warp perform a reduction. So, for each row, the threads in the block process the elements in that row, and then perform a reduction.

But how to structure this? Let me think about the steps:

For each row in the input tensor (each row is of length N), we need to compute the max. So, the kernel will process each row, and for each row, compute the max of N elements.

So, the kernel will have to loop over each row. Let's assume that the kernel is written in a way that each thread is responsible for a single row. But that might not be efficient if the number of rows is large. Alternatively, each block can handle a single row, and each thread in the block handles a single element in that row.

But let's think about the parameters. The input tensor is [M, N], and the output is [M]. So, for each row i, we need to compute the max of elements from i*N to (i+1)*N in the input tensor.

So, the kernel needs to process each row. Let's consider that each block is responsible for processing one row. The number of blocks would be M. However, in Triton, the number of blocks is determined by the kernel's launch configuration. But for this problem, the kernel can be written to process each row in a separate block.

But how to handle the row index? Let me think about the kernel's parameters. The kernel will be called with the input tensor, output tensor, and the dimensions M and N. Then, each thread in the block will process a single element in the row. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, each thread in the block can process a chunk of elements in the row, and then perform a reduction.

Alternatively, for each row, we can use a standard reduction approach.

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the maximum value). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the max of N elements.

Now, considering how Triton works, I need to figure out the GPU operations. The kernel will process each row, and for each row, iterate through all the elements to find the maximum. But how to structure this in Triton?

The input tensor is 2D, shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the max of the corresponding row.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The input is [M, N], output is [M]. The memory layout is important. Since we're processing rows, each row is a column in the input tensor. Wait, no, in the tensor, the first dimension is M (rows), second is N (columns). So for each row, we need to process N elements.

Now, the kernel needs to process each row. So the rows are the primary dimension. So for each row i, we need to compute the max of elements from column 0 to N-1.

In Triton, we can use a grid of threads where each thread handles a row. But how to handle the elements in the row? For each row, we can have a thread that processes all elements in the row. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, we can have each thread process a single element in the row, but that would require more threads.

Wait, but for a max reduction, it's common to use a parallel reduction. However, in this case, since the reduction is along the last dimension, and each row is independent, perhaps each row can be processed in parallel. So for each row, we can have multiple threads working on that row, but that's not necessary. Alternatively, we can have each thread handle a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction.

But for a 2D tensor, each row has N elements. So for each row, the number of elements is N. The max reduction for a row can be done with a parallel reduction. However, in Triton, the kernel is written in a way that each thread handles a certain part of the data.

So, the approach could be: for each row, process all elements in the row, and compute the max. The kernel will have a grid of threads where each thread is responsible for a row. But how to structure the threads to handle the elements in the row.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured with each thread handling a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction. But that would require a lot of threads. However, for each row, the number of elements is N, so if we have N threads per row, that's possible.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a grid and a block. Let me think about the block size. Let's say we use a block size of 1024. Then, for each row, the threads in the block can process elements in the row. But how to organize that.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is written such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. Then, for each row, the threads in the block process all elements, and then perform a reduction to find the max.

But for that, the kernel would need to have a loop over the elements in the row. So, for each row i, the threads in the block process elements j from 0 to N-1. But how to structure this.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a loop over the rows, and for each row, process the elements. Let me think of the kernel parameters. The input tensor is a 2D tensor, so in Triton, the kernel will take the input and output tensors, and the dimensions M and N.

So, the kernel will have parameters like:

@triton.jit
def kernel(
    input: tl.tensor,
    output: tl.tensor,
    M: tl.int32,
    N: tl.int32,
    ...
)

Then, the kernel will process each row. For each row i, the thread will process the elements in that row.

But how to structure the threads. Let's think of the grid as being divided into rows. Each thread in the grid is responsible for a row. Then, for each row, the thread processes all elements in that row. But that's not efficient because each thread would have to process N elements, which could be a lot.

Alternatively, perhaps we can have each thread process a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction. But that would require

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to compute C = A * B, where A is MxK and B is KxN. The result C should be MxN. So each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

In Triton, I need to handle this with threads. Each thread should compute one element of C. But how to organize the threads? For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to have each thread compute a single element, but that might not be the most efficient. Alternatively, we can use block sizes that allow for better memory access patterns.

Let me recall that in Triton, the kernel is written in a way that each thread handles a part of the computation. For matrix multiplication, the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element of the result. But with large matrices, this can be inefficient because of poor memory access patterns. However, given that the user is asking for a Triton kernel, maybe the standard approach is acceptable here.

So, the plan is: each thread computes one element of C. The thread index (i, j) corresponds to the element C[i][j]. But how to map the thread index to the elements in A and B?

Wait, in matrix multiplication, each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So for each i and j, we need to iterate over k. But in Triton, threads are usually arranged in a grid and blocks. So perhaps we need to use a block size that allows for each thread to handle a certain range of k.

Alternatively, maybe using a block size that allows for each thread to compute a single element. Let's think about the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. So for A, each row is contiguous. Similarly for B.

But for each element C[i][j], we need to access A[i][k] and B[k][j] for all k. So each thread would need to iterate over k, but that's not efficient. Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the k index. So each thread would have a loop over k, and accumulate the sum.

But how to structure the threads. Let me think about the grid and block dimensions. For example, if we have a grid of size M x N, each thread would compute one element. But that's not efficient. However, in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the threads. Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured with a block size that allows for each thread to compute a single element.

Alternatively, maybe using a block size that allows for each thread to handle a certain number of k's. But I think that for the sake of simplicity, given that the user is asking for a Triton kernel, the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element, and loop over k.

So, the steps are:

1. Determine the thread indices. Each thread is responsible for computing C[i][j], where i is the row index and j is the column index.

But how to map the thread index to i and j. For example, if the kernel is written with a grid of size M x N, then each thread would have i = thread_idx[0], j = thread_idx[1]. But that's not possible because the grid size is determined by the number of elements in C, which is M*N. However, in Triton, the kernel is written with a grid that is determined by the number of rows and columns. Wait, perhaps the kernel is structured with a grid of size (M, N), and each thread is responsible for computing C[i][j].

But in that case, the kernel would have to loop over i and j, and for each, loop over k. However, that might not be efficient because for each thread, the loop over k would be in the same thread, which could be slow. But maybe with proper memory access patterns, it can be optimized.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured with a block size that allows for each thread to compute a single element, but with the loops over k being handled in a way that uses shared memory or registers efficiently.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the threads. For example, the kernel is written with a loop over the number of rows and columns, and for each, compute the element. But perhaps the standard approach is to have a loop over the k index.

But I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The standard matrix multiplication in Triton is usually done with a block size that allows for each thread to compute a portion of the matrix. For example, each thread computes a

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first matrix is MxK, the second is KxN, so the result should be MxN. Each element in the result is the sum of the product of elements from the first row and second column, for each k in 0 to K-1.

Now, considering Triton's capabilities. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows for efficient kernel writing. The kernel will need to handle the computation in a way that maximizes memory access efficiency and uses coalesced memory access.

Let me recall how matrix multiplication is typically handled in Triton. Usually, each thread block handles a block of rows and columns. For example, each thread might compute one element of the result matrix. But since K can be large, we need to optimize the inner loop over K.

Wait, but in matrix multiplication, the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element of the result. However, with large K, this could be slow. So maybe we need to optimize by using shared memory to store the relevant parts of the matrices.

But the user hasn't specified whether the matrices are in row-major or column-major order. Typically, in Triton, matrices are stored in row-major, but I need to make sure about the memory layout.

Assuming that the input tensors are stored in row-major order. So, for the first matrix A (MxK), each row is stored contiguously. Similarly for B (KxN), each row is contiguous.

But for matrix multiplication, the inner loop is over the K dimension. So, for each element (i,j) in the result, we need to compute sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

So, in the kernel, each thread would compute one element of the result. But for that, each thread needs to access A[i][k] and B[k][j] for all k. However, if K is large, this could be inefficient because each thread would have to load K elements from each matrix, which could lead to poor memory throughput.

To optimize, we can use shared memory. The idea is to load a block of rows from A into shared memory, and a block of columns from B into shared memory. Then, each thread can compute the sum over the shared memory elements.

But how to structure this? Let's think about the block size. Let's say each thread block handles a certain number of rows from A and columns from B. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread block can handle 32 rows of A and 32 columns of B. But this depends on the problem size.

Alternatively, for each element in the result matrix, the thread computes it by iterating over K. However, this could be slow if K is large. So, perhaps using a more optimized approach with shared memory.

Wait, but the user hasn't specified any particular constraints on the input sizes. So maybe the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element, but with proper memory access patterns.

Alternatively, using a more efficient approach where each thread block handles a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B, and uses shared memory to store the relevant parts of A and B.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the block size. Let's say each thread block handles a block of rows from A (say, block_rows) and a block of columns from B (block_cols). Then, each thread in the block would compute a portion of the result matrix.

But maybe that's more complex. Alternatively, each thread computes one element of the result matrix. So, for each element (i,j), the thread would compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But for this, each thread needs to access A[i][k] and B[k][j] for all k. However, if K is large, this would require a lot of memory accesses. So, to optimize, we can use shared memory to store a block of A's rows and B's columns.

But how to structure this? Let's think about the following:

- Each thread block handles a certain number of rows from A (say, block_rows) and a certain number of columns from B (block_cols). Then, each thread in the block would compute a portion of the result matrix.

But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think again.

In standard matrix multiplication, the kernel is structured with each thread computing one element. So, for each element (i,j) in the result, the thread computes sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But for this, each thread needs to access A[i][k] and B[k][j] for all k. However, if

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to compute the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. So for each row (each M element), I need to sum all the elements in that row and then divide by N. Since it's a mean, I have to handle the division properly, but maybe I can do it in a way that avoids floating-point issues, like using integer division if possible. Wait, but the problem says "mean reduction", so the result should be a float. So I'll need to sum each row and then divide by N.

Now, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

Memory layout: The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. The output tensor will be a 1D array where each element corresponds to a row's mean.

Next, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels typically use a grid of blocks, each processing a portion of the data. For this problem, each block can handle one row. But since each row has N elements, I need to process N elements per block. However, if N is large, maybe using a block size that's a multiple of N would be better. Wait, but for each row, the block would need to process all N elements. Alternatively, maybe each block processes a single row, and the block size is determined by the number of elements per row. But since N can vary, perhaps using a dynamic block size isn't feasible. Alternatively, maybe each thread processes one element in the row, and the block handles all elements of a row. But that depends on how the threads are arranged.

Wait, for a 2D tensor, each row has N elements. So for each row, we need to sum all N elements. So each block can handle one row. Let's say each block processes one row. Then, the number of blocks would be M. Each block would have threads that process each element in the row. But how to arrange this.

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. So for each row, there are N threads, each processing one element. But then, the block size would be N, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, using a block size that's a multiple of N. But if N is not a power of two, that could be tricky. However, Triton allows for dynamic block sizes. Wait, but the block size is specified in the @triton.jit decorator. So perhaps I need to choose a block size that can handle the elements per row. But since N can vary, maybe the block size is set to a value that's a multiple of the number of elements per row. However, for a general case, maybe it's better to have each thread process one element in the row. So the block size would be the number of elements per row, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, using a block size that's a power of two, like 256, and then using a loop over the elements in the row.

Wait, but the problem is that for each row, we need to sum N elements. So for each row, the threads in the block would process each element. Let's think about the kernel structure. The kernel will have a grid of blocks, each processing a row. Each block has multiple threads, each processing one element in the row. Then, the threads in the block would sum the elements of the row.

But how to structure this. Let me think about the parameters. The kernel needs to take the input tensor, and output tensor. The input is [M, N], output is [M]. So for each row i, we need to sum all elements in row i, then divide by N.

So, the kernel will have a loop over the rows. Each block handles one row. Then, within the block, each thread processes one element in the row. But how to map the threads to the elements. Let's say that for each row, the threads are arranged in a way that each thread handles one element. So for a row i, the elements are at positions (i, 0), (i, 1), ..., (i, N-1). So each thread in the block would process one element of the row.

But how to handle the threads. Let's say that the block size is 256. Then, for each row, the threads would be numbered from 0 to 255. But if N is smaller than 256, then the threads beyond N-1 would be out of bounds. So

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to compute the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. So for each row (each M element), I need to sum all the elements in that row and then divide by N. Since it's a mean along the last dimension, each row is a separate computation.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

Memory layout: The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. For each row, we need to access all N elements. The output tensor will have one element per row.

Optimal block sizes: Since each row is processed independently, I can use a block size that allows each thread to handle one row. But wait, maybe I should think in terms of threads per block. If each thread processes one row, then the block size can be set to 1, but that's not efficient. Alternatively, maybe use a block size that processes multiple rows, but since each row is independent, it's better to have each thread handle one row. However, in Triton, the kernel is typically written with a grid that has as many threads as needed. Wait, perhaps I should structure the kernel such that each thread handles one row. So, for each row, a thread computes the sum and then divides by N.

Wait, but for a 2D tensor, each row has N elements. So for each row i, the thread would need to load all N elements from the input tensor, sum them, then divide by N. But how to handle that in Triton?

Let me think about the kernel structure. The kernel will have a grid of threads, each responsible for a row. So the number of threads in the grid is M. Each thread processes one row. So for each row i, the thread will compute the sum of elements from column 0 to N-1 in that row.

But how to access the elements? The input tensor is stored as [M, N], so for row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j for j in 0..N-1. Wait, no, if it's a 2D tensor, the memory layout is row-major, so each row is stored contiguously. So for row i, the elements are at i * N + j, where j is the column index. So for each row i, the thread needs to load all N elements.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows. So the kernel will have a loop over the rows, and for each row, loop over the columns to sum.

But wait, in Triton, the kernel is written with a grid and a block. Let's think about the parameters. The kernel needs to take the input tensor, the number of rows M, the number of columns N, and the output tensor.

So the kernel will be something like:

@triton.jit
def kernel(...):
    # compute the row index
    row = ... 
    # compute the sum for this row
    sum_val = 0
    for col in range(N):
        sum_val += tl.load(input_ptr + row * N + col)
    # compute mean
    mean_val = sum_val / N
    tl.store(output_ptr + row, mean_val)

But wait, how to handle the row index? The grid is determined by the number of rows. So the grid size would be M, and each thread handles one row.

But in Triton, the kernel is called with a grid size, and each thread has a tid (thread index). So the row index is the tid.

So the kernel would be:

@triton.jit
def kernel(input, output, M, N, ...):
    row = tl.arange(0, 1)  # Wait, no. Wait, the grid is M threads. So each thread is assigned a row index. So in the kernel, the row is the thread index.

Wait, maybe the kernel is structured as follows: The grid has M threads, each thread is responsible for a row. So in the kernel, the row index is the thread index. So for each thread, we compute the sum for that row.

But how to handle the loop over the columns? For each row, the thread needs to iterate over all N columns and sum them.

But for large N, this could be slow. However, in Triton, the loop is in the kernel, and the kernel is written in a way that allows for vectorization. But for this problem, since each row is independent, the code can be written

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through the steps.

First, the GPU operations. Matrix multiplication involves multiplying elements of the first matrix with corresponding elements of the second matrix and summing the products. Since we're using shared memory, I'll need to load tiles of the input matrices into shared memory to optimize memory access.

The input tensors are A (M, K) and B (K, N). The output is C (M, N), where each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k. 

For tile-based computation, I'll divide the matrices into blocks (tiles) of size, say, BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K, and BLOCK_N. The shared memory will hold these tiles. The key is to process each tile of A and B, compute the product, and accumulate the result into C.

Now, the input and output tensor shapes. Let's assume that the input tensors are stored in row-major order. The output tensor C will be of size M x N. The shared memory for A and B will be of size (BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K) and (BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N) respectively. 

Next, block sizes. The block size should be chosen to maximize throughput. Common choices are 128, 256, etc. Let's pick BLOCK_SIZE = 128. For the blocks, I'll use BLOCK_M = 128, BLOCK_K = 128, and BLOCK_N = 128. But I need to make sure that the blocks fit into the shared memory and that the memory access is coalesced.

Memory access patterns: For each thread in the block, it will handle a specific element in the tile. For A, each thread will load a row of A's tile, and for B, each thread will load a column of B's tile. Then, the product is computed and accumulated into C.

Edge cases: When the matrix dimensions are not multiples of the block size, the last tile might be smaller. Also, when K is smaller than the block size, the threads in the block might not have work. So, I need to handle these cases with masking. For example, when K is smaller than BLOCK_K, the threads beyond K in the block should not process anything.

Now, the Triton kernel structure. The kernel will have a loop over the rows of C (i), and for each row, a loop over the columns (j). Each thread will compute a single element of C[i][j]. But since we're using tiles, we need to process tiles of A and B.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to have each thread block process a tile of A and B. For example, each thread block handles a tile of A (BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K) and a tile of B (BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N). Then, the product is computed and stored in C. But since C is of size M x N, each thread block would handle a tile of C as well.

Alternatively, for each element in C, we can compute it by iterating over K. But with tile-based computation, we can process multiple elements at once.

Let me think again. The standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to use a loop over the rows of A and columns of B, and for each element in C, compute the sum over K. However, with shared memory, we can load a tile of A and B into shared memory, compute the product, and then accumulate into C.

So, the kernel will have:

- A loop over the rows of A (i) and columns of B (j).
- For each i and j, compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But with tile-based computation, we can process multiple i and j at once. Let me structure the kernel with the following steps:

1. Each thread block processes a tile of A (BLOCK_M rows x BLOCK_K columns) and a tile of B (BLOCK_K rows x BLOCK_N columns). The output tile is BLOCK_M x BLOCK_N.

2. The threads in the block are divided into groups that handle different parts of the tile.

But maybe a better way is to have each thread block compute a block of C. For example, each thread block handles a block of C (BLOCK_M rows x BLOCK_N columns), and for each element in that block, compute the sum over K.

But how to do that with shared memory? Let's outline the steps:

- Load the tile of A into shared memory (A_shm) of size (BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K).
- Load the tile of B into shared memory (B_shm) of size (BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N).
- For each element in the output tile

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in Triton.

First, the input tensors are A (M x K) and B (K x N). The output is C (M x N), where each element C[i,j] is the sum of A[i,k] * B[k,j] for all k. But since we're using tile-based computation, we'll need to break this down into smaller blocks that fit into shared memory.

Triton kernels typically use a grid of blocks, each handling a portion of the matrix. For matrix multiplication, each block might handle a tile of A and B, compute the product, and store the result in C. The key is to manage shared memory efficiently to avoid bank conflicts and ensure coalesced memory access.

So, the plan is to split the matrices into tiles. Let's say each tile is of size TILE_M x TILE_K for matrix A, and TILE_K x TILE_N for matrix B. But since A is M x K and B is K x N, the tiles for A and B should be compatible. Wait, actually, the tile size for A would be TILE_M x TILE_K, and for B it's TILE_K x TILE_N. But since K is the same dimension, the tiles for A and B need to be aligned so that the K dimension is handled properly.

Wait, maybe the tile size for A is TILE_M x TILE_K, and for B it's TILE_K x TILE_N. Then, each block would compute a portion of the output matrix C. But how to manage the shared memory for these tiles?

In Triton, each block can have its own shared memory. So, for each block, we'll load a tile of A into shared memory, then load a tile of B into shared memory. Then, perform the multiplication and accumulation.

But how to split the matrices into tiles? Let's assume that the tile size is TILE_M = 32, TILE_K = 32, and TILE_N = 32. These are common sizes for efficient memory access. But the actual values might depend on the problem size. However, the user hasn't specified specific sizes, so I'll use standard values.

The steps would be:

1. For each block, determine the range of rows and columns in A and B that it's responsible for.
2. Load the corresponding tiles of A and B into shared memory.
3. Perform the matrix multiplication on the shared memory tiles.
4. Write the result back to the output tensor C.

But wait, since A is M x K and B is K x N, the tiles for A and B need to be aligned such that the K dimension is handled. For example, if the tile size is TILE_K, then each block would process a TILE_K x TILE_K portion of A and B. But maybe I should think in terms of the block's position in the matrix.

Alternatively, for each block, we can compute a portion of the output matrix. Let's say that each block is responsible for computing a submatrix of C. The block's position in the grid would determine which part of C it's handling. But how to split the computation into tiles?

Another approach is to use the standard matrix multiplication approach with shared memory. For each block, we load a tile of A (rows i to i+TILE_M-1, columns j to j+TILE_K-1) and a tile of B (rows k to k+TILE_K-1, columns l to l+TILE_N-1). Wait, but the dimensions might not align. Let me think again.

Actually, in matrix multiplication, the tiles for A and B would be such that the K dimension is split into tiles. So, for A (M x K), each tile is TILE_M x TILE_K. For B (K x N), each tile is TILE_K x TILE_N. Then, each block would compute a portion of C by multiplying the corresponding tiles of A and B.

But how to map the block's position to the tiles of A and B? For example, each block would handle a certain number of rows in A and columns in B. Wait, maybe the block is responsible for a certain number of rows in A and columns in B, but since the K dimension is the same, the tiles for A and B must be aligned.

Alternatively, the block's position in the grid determines the row and column in C that it's responsible for. For example, each block computes a submatrix of C, which is TILE_M x TILE_N. But how does that work with the K dimension?

Wait, maybe the block is responsible for a certain number of rows in A and columns in B. For example, each block would process a TILE_M x TILE_K portion of A and a

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by understanding what's required here.

First, matrix multiplication between a MxK matrix and a KxN matrix results in a MxN matrix. So the output tensor will have shape [M, N]. The kernel needs to compute each element of this output matrix by taking the dot product of the corresponding row from the first matrix and column from the second matrix.

Now, thinking about how to structure the Triton kernel. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows for efficient parallelism. The kernel will be written in a way that leverages warp-level parallelism and efficient memory access.

Let me recall the steps for matrix multiplication in Triton. Each thread in the kernel is responsible for computing one element of the output matrix. For that, each thread needs to access elements from the first matrix (A) and the second matrix (B), multiply them, and sum the products.

But wait, how to handle the indices? Let's think about the indices. For the output element (i, j), it's the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So each thread will need to iterate over the K elements, but that's not efficient. Wait, no, in matrix multiplication, each thread is responsible for one element of the output. So for each element (i,j), the thread computes the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. But if K is large, this could be slow. However, Triton allows for using a block size that can handle this efficiently.

But wait, in the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton, each thread is responsible for one element of the output. So for each (i,j), the thread computes the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. But this requires that each thread has to process K elements, which could be expensive if K is large. However, the block size can be chosen to optimize this. For example, using a block size of 16 or 32, and having each thread handle a certain number of k's. But maybe that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe we can use a more efficient approach where each thread is responsible for a block of elements.

Wait, but in the standard approach, each thread is responsible for one element. So for each element (i,j), the thread computes the sum over k. So the kernel would have to loop over k for each (i,j). But that's not efficient for large K. However, Triton can handle this with proper memory access patterns and maybe using a block size that allows for some level of parallelism.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a certain number of elements in the output. But that might complicate things. Let me think again.

The standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to have each thread compute one element of the output. So, the kernel would have to loop over k for each (i,j). But for that, each thread would need to access A[i][k] and B[k][j] for all k. However, if K is large, this could be slow. But with proper memory access patterns and using shared memory, this can be optimized.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the input tensors are [M, K] and [K, N]. So the first matrix is M rows and K columns, the second is K rows and N columns. The output is M rows and N columns.

So, for each element (i,j) in the output, we need to compute the sum over k from 0 to K-1 of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

In Triton, each thread is responsible for one element of the output. So the kernel will have to loop over k for each (i,j). But that's not efficient for large K. However, if we can use shared memory to store the elements of A and B that are needed for the computation, that can speed things up.

But in this case, the problem is that for each (i,j), the thread has to access K elements from A and B. So if K is large, this would be slow. However, the kernel is written in such a way that each thread is responsible for one element, and the loop over k is handled in the kernel.

But how to structure the kernel. Let's think about the parameters. The kernel will take the two input tensors (A and B) and the output tensor (C). The kernel will be called with the shapes of A (M, K) and B (K, N), and the output C (M, N).

In Triton, the kernel is written with the @triton.jit decorator. The kernel will have parameters for the input and output tensors, along with their strides.

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by understanding what this entails.

First, the operation is matrix multiplication, so the first tensor is MxK and the second is KxN. The result should be an MxN matrix. Each element in the output is the sum of the products of elements from the rows of the first matrix and columns of the second matrix.

Now, thinking about how to implement this in Triton. Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for GPU execution, so I need to structure the code with proper memory access patterns and block sizes.

Let me recall that in Triton, each kernel is divided into warps, and each warp processes a block of elements. The block size is usually chosen based on the problem size. For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that allows for efficient memory access, like 256 or 128 elements per block.

But wait, the standard matrix multiplication in Triton often uses a block size that's a multiple of 32, like 128 or 256. Let me think about the dimensions. For each element in the output matrix, we need to compute the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix. So, for each element (i, j) in the output, we need to compute sum_{k=0}^{K-1} A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But how to structure this in a kernel. The standard approach is to have each thread compute one element of the output. However, that might not be efficient because of memory access patterns. Alternatively, we can use a more optimized approach where each thread block handles a submatrix, but for this problem, since the matrices are MxK and KxN, maybe the standard approach is better.

Wait, but the problem is that K can be large. So, for each element in the output, we need to iterate over K elements. However, if K is large, this could be slow. So, perhaps using a block size that allows for more efficient computation.

Alternatively, maybe using a tile-based approach where each block processes a tile of the matrices. But that might complicate things. Let me think again.

In the standard Triton matrix multiplication kernel, each thread is responsible for computing one element of the output. The threads are arranged in a grid that covers the output matrix. Each thread loads the corresponding elements from the input matrices, multiplies them, and accumulates the sum.

But for this problem, the input matrices are [M, K] and [K, N]. So, the output is [M, N]. So, each thread would compute one element (i, j) in the output. The thread index would be (i, j), and for each element, we need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But how to map this to the kernel. Let me think about the memory layout. The input matrices are stored as 2D tensors. In Triton, the kernel needs to access these tensors. The first matrix is M rows, K columns. The second is K rows, N columns.

So, for each thread, the index i is the row in the first matrix, j is the column in the second matrix. Then, for each k in 0 to K-1, we multiply A[i][k] and B[k][j], sum them up.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the threads. So, the kernel would have a loop over the output elements, and for each element, compute the sum.

But for this, the kernel needs to be structured with a loop over k. However, if K is large, this could be slow. So, perhaps using a block size that allows for more efficient computation.

Alternatively, maybe using a block size that's a multiple of K, but that depends on the problem. Let me think about the block size. Let's say we use a block size of 128. Each thread would handle one element of the output. Then, for each element, the thread would iterate over k from 0 to K-1. But if K is large, this could be slow. However, in Triton, the loop is unrolled, but the code would need to be optimized for memory access.

Wait, but the problem is that each thread would have to load K elements from each matrix. That's not efficient. So, perhaps the standard approach is to use a block size that allows for more efficient computation. For example, using a block size that's a multiple of 32, and each thread block handles a tile of the matrices.

But given that the problem is to multiply two matrices, maybe the standard approach is to use a kernel where each thread

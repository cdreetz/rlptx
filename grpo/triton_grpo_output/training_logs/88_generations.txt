Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the minimum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the minimum element). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the min of N elements.

Next, input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Memory layout: The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. The output will be a 1D array where each element corresponds to a row's minimum.

Optimal block sizes and memory access patterns. Since each row is processed independently, we can process each row in a separate thread block. The number of threads per block should be chosen based on the number of elements per row. For a row of N elements, a block size of N would be ideal, but that might be too large for some cases. Alternatively, using a block size that's a power of two, like 256, might be better. However, since each thread needs to process one element in the row, perhaps a block size of 256 would allow each thread to handle one element, but with some overhead. Wait, maybe for each row, we can have multiple threads working on different elements. But since we need to find the minimum, each thread would need to compare with others. Alternatively, using a reduction approach where threads collaborate to find the minimum.

Wait, the standard way to compute min in a reduction is to have each thread process a portion of the data, and then reduce across the threads. But in this case, since each row is independent, perhaps each thread block can handle one row. So for each row, we can have a thread block that processes all N elements in that row, and computes the minimum.

But how to structure the threads. Let's think: for each row, we can have a thread block that processes that row. The number of threads per block would be the number of elements in the row (N), but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, we can have a block size that's a power of two, and each thread handles a portion of the row. But since the row is of length N, which may not be a power of two, we need to handle that.

Alternatively, for each row, we can have a thread block where each thread is responsible for a single element. Then, the threads in the block can perform a reduction to find the minimum. But that would require that each thread has a value, and then they reduce across the block.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, if each thread is responsible for one element, then the number of threads per block is N. But if N is large, say 1024, then each block would have 1024 threads, which is possible. However, the block size is limited by the GPU's maximum number of threads per block, which is usually 1024. So if N is up to 1024, then a block can process one row. But if N is larger than 1024, then we need multiple blocks per row. But since the input is [M, N], and each row is processed independently, perhaps the kernel is designed to process each row in a separate block.

But how to structure the kernel. The kernel needs to process each row. Let me think about the parameters. The kernel will take the input tensor, the output tensor, the dimensions M and N. The kernel will process each row (i.e., each row index) and compute the minimum of that row.

So the kernel should have a loop over the rows (M), and for each row, compute the minimum of the N elements in that row.

But how to structure the threads. For each row, we can have a thread block that processes that row. The number of threads per block would be the number of elements in the row (N), but that's not efficient if N is large. Alternatively, we can use a block size that's a power of two, and have each thread process a portion of the row, then perform a reduction.

Alternatively, for each row, we can have a thread block where each thread is responsible for a single element, and then the threads in the block perform a reduction to find the minimum. That's the standard reduction approach.

So the kernel will have a loop over the rows (M). For each row, we have a block of threads that process that row. Each thread in the block is responsible for one element in the row. Then, the threads in the block reduce to find

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the min reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is to find the minimum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor). So for each row (each M element), I need to find the minimum among the N elements in that row.

Let me recall how Triton kernels work. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA, but with more flexibility and higher performance. The kernel will process elements in blocks, with each block handling a certain number of elements.

So, the input tensor is 2D with shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Now, considering the GPU operations. For each row (each M), we need to iterate through all N elements and find the minimum. So, for each row, the kernel needs to process all N elements in that row.

In Triton, each thread block can handle a certain number of rows. Let's think about the block size. Let's say we have a block size of, say, 256. But since each row has N elements, the block size needs to be chosen such that each thread can process a portion of the row. Wait, maybe I should structure the kernel so that each thread handles a single element in the row, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each thread can handle a single element, but with some way to track the minimum.

Wait, but for each row, the minimum can be found by having multiple threads work on that row. For example, if the block size is 256, each block can handle one row. But if the row has N elements, then each thread in the block can process a portion of the row. Wait, but if the block is responsible for a single row, then each thread in the block can process a single element. However, that might not be efficient because each thread would need to read the element and compare it with the current minimum.

Alternatively, maybe each block is responsible for a single row. For each row, the block processes all N elements. But how to do that in Triton. Let me think.

In Triton, each thread in a block can process a single element. So for a row of N elements, each thread would process one element. But for each row, we need to find the minimum. So, for each row, the threads in the block would read the elements and compute the minimum.

But how to do that. Let me think of the steps:

1. For each row i in 0 to M-1:
   a. For each element j in 0 to N-1:
      i. Read the value from input[i][j]
      ii. Compare with current minimum and update if necessary.

But how to do this in a parallel way. Since each thread can process one element, but for each row, we need to find the minimum. So, the kernel needs to process each row, and for each row, compute the minimum.

So, the kernel will have to loop over the rows. Each thread block will handle one row. Let me think about the block size. Suppose each block is responsible for one row. Then, the number of blocks is M. Each block will have N elements to process. But how to handle that.

Wait, but for each row, the number of elements is N. So, if the block size is 256, then for each row, the block can process up to 256 elements. But if N is larger than 256, then multiple threads per block would be needed. However, if N is smaller than the block size, then the threads can process the elements in the row.

But how to structure this. Maybe the kernel is designed such that each thread in the block processes a single element in the row. So, for each row, the threads in the block process all elements in that row, and compute the minimum.

But how to do that. Let me think about the kernel's parameters. The input is a 2D tensor, and the output is a 1D tensor of size M.

The kernel will need to:

- For each row i in 0 to M-1:
   - Initialize the minimum value as the first element of the row.
   - For each element j in 1 to N-1:
      - Compare with current minimum and update if necessary.

But in Triton, each thread can process a single element. So, for a row, each thread can process one element. However, for each row, we need to find the minimum. So, the threads in the block would need to work together to compute the minimum.

Wait, but how to do

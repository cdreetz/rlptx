Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the maximum value in each row of a 2D tensor. Since the tensor is [M, N], each row has N elements, and we need to compute the max for each of the M rows.

So, the input is a 2D tensor, and the output is a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the max of the corresponding row.

Now, thinking about how to structure the Triton kernel. Triton kernels are written in a way that uses threads to process elements in a grid. For this problem, each thread should handle a single row. But wait, maybe not. Wait, the kernel needs to process all rows. So perhaps each thread is responsible for a single row, and then compute the max for that row.

But how to handle the data. Let's think about the memory layout. The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. So for a given row i, the elements are at positions i*N, i*N+1, ..., i*N + N-1.

But in Triton, the kernel needs to process this data. So the kernel will have to iterate over each row, and for each row, iterate over the elements to find the maximum.

But how to structure the threads. Let's think about the grid and the blocks. For each row, we can have a thread per element. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread handle a range of elements in the row. But for max reduction, it's better to have each thread process a chunk of elements and then combine the results.

But since the rows are of length N, and we need to find the max for each row, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. But that would require M threads, each processing one element. However, that might not be efficient because for each row, you need to compare all elements. So maybe a better approach is to have each thread handle a chunk of elements in the row, and then combine the results.

Alternatively, since the rows are independent, we can process each row in parallel. So for each row, we can have a group of threads that compute the max for that row. But how to structure that.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single row. So the grid is of size M, and each thread processes one row. Then, for each row, the thread needs to find the maximum of all N elements in that row.

But how to do that in Triton. Let's think about the kernel parameters. The input tensor is a 2D tensor, and the output is a 1D tensor of size M.

So, the kernel will need to:

1. For each row i (from 0 to M-1):
   a. Iterate over all elements in the row (from 0 to N-1)
   b. Find the maximum value in that row.

But how to do this in Triton. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The kernel will need to know the shape of the input tensor (M, N), and the output tensor (M, 1).

So, the kernel's parameters would include the input tensor, the output tensor, the M and N values.

Now, the kernel's code structure would be:

@triton.jit
def kernel(...):
    # get the row index
    row = ... 
    # compute the max for this row
    # store the result in output[row]

But how to compute the max for the row. For a given row, the elements are at positions row * N + col, for col in 0 to N-1.

So, for each row, the thread can iterate over the elements and find the max. But how to do that efficiently.

But if each thread is responsible for a single row, then for each row, the thread would have to load all N elements and compute the max. However, that would require a lot of memory accesses. So, perhaps a better approach is to have each thread handle a chunk of elements in the row, and then combine the results.

Alternatively, since the rows are independent, perhaps the kernel can be structured such that each thread handles a single element in the row, and then compare with the current max. But that would require a lot of threads for each row. For example, if N is 1024, then each row would need 1024 threads, which might not be efficient.

But maybe for this problem, given that the rows are independent, it's better to process each row in a way that each thread handles a single element. However, that might not be efficient in terms of memory access. Let

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the tensor, find the maximum value). So for each row (each M element), we need to find the maximum among the N elements.

Now, considering how Triton works, I need to structure the kernel to process the tensor efficiently. The kernel will run on the GPU, so I need to make sure that memory accesses are coalesced and that the operations are done in a way that minimizes memory latency.

The input tensor is 2D with shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the maximum of the corresponding row.

Let me think about the grid and block structure. Since we're processing each row independently, each block can handle one row. But wait, how many blocks do I need? The number of rows is M, so the grid size would be M blocks. But in Triton, the grid is determined by the number of blocks, and each block processes a certain number of elements.

Wait, but for each row, we need to process N elements. So, each block can process a certain number of elements in a row. Let me decide on the block size. Let's say each block processes a certain number of elements in the row. But since each row is of length N, the number of blocks per row would be ceil(N / BLOCK_SIZE). However, since each row is processed by a single block, maybe I should structure it so that each block handles one row. Wait, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, perhaps each block processes a portion of the row.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For each row, we need to compute the maximum of N elements. So, for each row, we can have a thread per element, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, we can have threads that work in a way to find the maximum in parallel.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows, and for each row, process the elements. So, the kernel should have a loop over the rows, and for each row, process the elements in that row.

But how to structure this. Let me think about the kernel parameters. The input tensor is a 2D tensor, so in Triton, I need to pass it as a pointer, and then access it with row and column indices.

So, the kernel will have a grid of size M, and each block processes one row. But how to handle the elements in that row. Let me think about the block size. Let's say each block has a certain number of threads, say BLOCK_SIZE. For each row, the threads in the block will process the elements in that row.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, if the block has BLOCK_SIZE threads, then each thread can process a certain number of elements. But how to handle that. Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then they compare their values to find the maximum. But that would require a reduction step within the block.

Wait, that's a common approach. For each row, we can have a reduction over the elements. So, for each row, we can have a block of threads that process the elements in that row, and perform a reduction to find the maximum.

So, the steps would be:

1. For each row (i) in the input tensor:
   a. For each element in the row (j from 0 to N-1), each thread in the block processes the element.
   b. The threads perform a reduction to find the maximum value in the row.

But how to structure the threads. Let's say that each block is responsible for processing one row. The number of blocks would be M (number of rows). Each block has a certain number of threads. The threads in the block will process the elements in the row.

But how to handle the elements in the row. For example, if the row has N elements, and the block has BLOCK_SIZE threads, then each thread can process a certain number of elements. But that's not straightforward. Alternatively, each thread can process one element, and then perform a reduction.

Wait, that's a better approach. Let's think: for each row, the threads in the block will process the elements in that row. Each thread is responsible for a single element. Then, the threads perform a reduction to find the maximum.

But how to do that. For example, in a block, the threads can be arranged in a way that they compare their values and propagate the maximum. So, for each row, the block will have a reduction over the elements of that row.

So, the kernel would look like:

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that adds two 1D tensors element-wise. Let me start by thinking about what operations are needed. The kernel should take two input tensors and produce an output tensor where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements from the inputs.

First, I should consider the GPU operations. Since Triton is a GPU programming language, I'll need to use the triton library. The kernel will be written in a way that's efficient for the GPU, using shared memory if necessary, but for simple operations like element-wise addition, maybe it's not needed. Wait, but for large N, using shared memory could help with coalesced memory access.

Next, input and output tensor shapes. The problem states that both inputs and output are 1D tensors of size N. So, each tensor has a shape of (N,). The kernel will process each element in the tensors. The key is to have each thread handle a single element, but with proper memory access patterns to maximize throughput.

Now, block sizes. Triton kernels are divided into blocks, and each block has a certain number of threads. For element-wise operations, a common approach is to have each thread handle one element. However, if the block size is larger, maybe we can have multiple threads per block processing different elements. But for simplicity, maybe a block size of 1 is sufficient, but that's not efficient. Wait, no, in Triton, each thread in a block can process a single element. But if the block size is larger, like 256, then each thread can handle a different element. Wait, no, the block size is the number of threads per block, and each thread can process one element. So, for N elements, the number of blocks would be ceil(N / block_size). But for a simple case, maybe using a block size of 1 is okay, but that's not efficient. Wait, no, in Triton, the block size is the number of threads per block. So, for example, if I have a block size of 256, then each block can handle 256 elements. But if the total number of elements is N, then the number of blocks would be ceil(N / 256). But for element-wise addition, each thread can process one element. So the kernel would loop over each element, and each thread computes the sum of the corresponding elements from the two input tensors.

But how to handle the indices? Each thread in the block would have an index, and then compute the corresponding element in the input tensors. However, if the block size is large, then each thread would have a different index. So the kernel would need to compute for each thread the index it's responsible for.

So the steps would be:

1. Determine the number of elements N.
2. For each thread in the block, compute its index i = thread_id within the block.
3. For each i, load the value from input1[i], input2[i], add them, and store in output[i].

But how to handle the memory access? For each thread, we need to access input1[i], input2[i], and output[i]. If the input tensors are stored in global memory, then each thread would load from global memory. However, for large N, this could be inefficient because each thread is loading from global memory, which is slow. So, to optimize, maybe we can use shared memory. But for this problem, since the operation is simple and the tensors are 1D, maybe using shared memory isn't necessary. However, for large N, using shared memory could help.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel can be written with each thread handling one element, and using global memory. But for that, the kernel would have to loop through each element. Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. Wait, no, Triton kernels are written with a loop over the elements, but each thread processes one element. So, for example, the kernel would have a loop that runs for each element, and each thread in the block processes one element.

Wait, maybe the kernel is structured as follows:

- The kernel is launched with a grid of blocks, each block processing a certain number of elements.
- Each thread in the block processes one element, using its thread index to determine which element to process.

But how to compute the thread index? For example, in a block of size 256, each thread has an id from 0 to 255. The total number of elements N is known, so each thread can compute its index as i = thread_id. Then, the kernel would process all elements from 0 to N-1.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. Wait, no, in Triton, you can use a loop that runs for each element, but each thread in the block can process one element

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that adds two 1D tensors element-wise. Let me start by thinking about what operations are required. The kernel should take two input tensors and produce an output tensor where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements from the inputs.

First, I need to figure out the GPU operations. Since it's element-wise addition, each thread will handle one element. But I should consider how to efficiently access the memory. Triton kernels use shared memory for better performance, so maybe I should load the input tensors into shared memory.

The input and output tensors are 1D, so their shapes are (N,) where N is the size. The kernel needs to process all elements. Each thread will compute one element. But how to handle the memory access? For each thread, I need to calculate the index in the input tensors and then add them.

Wait, in Triton, each thread is assigned a unique index. So I can use the thread index to compute the position in the input tensors. But if the tensors are large, loading them all into shared memory might be inefficient. However, for simplicity, maybe it's better to load each input into shared memory and then add them.

But wait, for a 1D tensor, each thread can load its own element from the input. Let me think about the block size. Let's say each block processes a certain number of elements. The block size should be chosen to maximize occupancy. Typically, for such operations, a block size of 256 is common, but maybe 128 or 512. But since each thread handles one element, the block size might not matter much here. Wait, no, if each thread handles one element, then the block size would be the number of threads per block. For example, if the block size is 256, then each block can handle 256 elements. But if the total number of elements is N, then the number of blocks would be ceil(N / 256).

But how to handle the indexing. For each thread in the block, the index is the thread index within the block. So for a block with 256 threads, each thread i in 0..255 would compute the global index as i + block_id * 256. But maybe that's not the right way. Wait, in Triton, the threads are assigned to positions in the input. So the kernel is launched with a grid of blocks, each block processing a certain number of elements. For example, if the kernel is launched with grid = (num_blocks, ), and each block processes a certain number of elements. But in this case, since it's a 1D tensor, each thread can process one element.

So the steps would be:

1. For each thread in the block, compute the index in the input tensors.
2. Load the elements from the input tensors at that index.
3. Add them together and store the result in the output tensor.

But how to handle the memory access. If the input tensors are stored in global memory, then each thread would need to load the element from global memory. However, for large N, this would be slow. So using shared memory would be better. But how to do that.

Wait, in Triton, you can use shared memory to store the input data. For example, each block can load a portion of the input into shared memory, then each thread can read from shared memory. But for this case, since each thread is handling one element, maybe it's better to just load from global memory. But that would be inefficient. Alternatively, if the block size is large enough, maybe the threads can load their own elements from global memory.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel can be written such that each thread loads its own element from the input tensors. Let me think about the code structure.

The kernel would have:

- Input tensors A and B, output tensor C.
- Each thread computes index i = tid (thread index in the block).
- Then, load A[i], B[i], add, store to C[i].

But how to handle the grid and block dimensions. The kernel is launched with a grid that has as many blocks as needed to cover all elements. For example, if N is 1024, then the grid would have 4 blocks (each block handles 256 elements). But in Triton, the kernel is written to process each element, so the grid is determined by the number of elements.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a grid of (num_blocks, ), and each block processes a certain number of elements. But for this case, since each thread processes one element, the number of threads per block is the same as the number of elements per block. So, for example, if the block size is 256, then each block handles 256 elements.

But how to compute the index. Let

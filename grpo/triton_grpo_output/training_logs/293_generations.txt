Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the minimum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the minimum element). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the minimum of N elements.

Now, considering how Triton works, I need to structure the kernel to process these elements efficiently. The input tensor is 2D, with shape [M, N], and the output will be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Next, I need to decide on the block size. Triton kernels typically use a block size that's a power of two, like 256 or 128. Since each block can process multiple elements, but in this case, each row has N elements. However, since we're processing rows, maybe the block size should be set such that each thread handles a single element in the row. Wait, but if we have multiple threads per block, each thread could handle a single element in the row, and then the block can compute the minimum across all elements in the row.

Wait, but for each row, there are N elements. So for each row, we need to find the minimum of N elements. So, for each row, we can have multiple threads working on that row. But how to structure this?

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then the block computes the minimum of all elements in the row. But that would require that each thread in the block processes one element, and then the block reduces them.

But for that, the block needs to have enough threads to process all elements in the row. However, if N is large, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can process the elements in a way that each thread handles a subset of the elements, and then perform a reduction.

But perhaps a better approach is to have each thread handle a single element in the row, and then the block reduces them. However, for that, the number of threads per block must be at least N. But if N is large, that's not feasible. So maybe we need to use a different approach.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is launched with a certain number of blocks and threads per block. So for each row, we can have a block that processes that row. But how to handle that.

Alternatively, for each row, we can have a block that processes all elements in that row. So for each row, the block has multiple threads, each responsible for a single element. Then, the block can compute the minimum of all elements in the row.

But how to structure this. Let me think about the kernel's parameters. The input tensor is of shape [M, N], and the output is [M]. So for each row i (from 0 to M-1), we need to compute the minimum of the elements in row i.

So, the kernel will have to process each row. Let's think about how to structure the threads. Each thread can be responsible for a single element in the row. But for a row with N elements, we need N threads per block. However, if N is large, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, perhaps we can use a reduction approach where each thread handles a group of elements and then reduces them.

But for this problem, since the reduction is along the last dimension (each row), perhaps the best approach is to have each thread process a single element in the row, and then the block reduces them to find the minimum.

But how to do that. Let's think about the kernel's code structure.

First, the kernel will have to process each row. So, the kernel will have to iterate over each row. For each row, the threads in the block will process the elements in that row.

But how to handle this in Triton. The kernel is launched with a grid of blocks, and each block processes a certain range of rows. Wait, maybe each block is responsible for processing a single row. So, for each row i, we have a block that processes that row. Then, the block will have multiple threads, each handling a single element in the row. Then, the block can compute the minimum of all elements in the row.

But how to structure that. Let me think about the parameters. The kernel will take the input tensor, and the output tensor. The kernel's code will have to loop over each row, and for each row, loop over the elements in the row, and compute the minimum.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a grid and a block. So perhaps the grid is M blocks, each block handling a single row. Then, within each block, the threads process

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations required. The task is to find the minimum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the minimum element). So for each row (each row is of length N), we need to compute the minimum.

Next, input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output will be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Memory layout: The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. The output tensor will be a 1D array where each element corresponds to a row's minimum.

Optimal block sizes and memory access patterns. Since we're processing each row independently, each thread block can handle one row. But wait, maybe it's better to have each thread handle a single element in the row. Let me think. For each row, we need to process all N elements. If we have a block size that can process all elements in a row, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, each thread could handle one element in the row. But for reduction, we need to find the minimum, so perhaps a reduction operation is needed. Wait, but the problem is to compute the minimum of each row. So for each row, we need to perform a reduction over the elements of that row.

So, the approach would be: for each row, each thread processes a single element, and then they reduce to find the minimum. But how to structure this in Triton.

Alternatively, for each row, we can have a thread block that processes all elements in the row. Let's think about the block size. If the block size is N, then each block can process one row. But if N is large, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, using a block size that allows for efficient reduction. For example, using a block size of 256, and for each row, each thread processes a single element, then they reduce across the block.

But since the rows are independent, maybe we can process each row in a separate block. But in Triton, the kernel is launched with a certain number of blocks and threads per block. So perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread block handles one row. For each row, the threads in the block process the elements of that row, and then compute the minimum.

So, for each row, the threads in the block will process the elements. Let's say the block size is 256. For a row of N elements, the threads in the block will process the elements, and then perform a reduction to find the minimum.

But how to structure the threads. Let's think: For each row, the threads in the block will be responsible for processing the elements of that row. Each thread can handle a single element, and then they reduce across the block.

So, the steps for the kernel:

1. For each row in the input tensor (each row is of length N), compute the minimum.

So, the kernel will iterate over each row. The number of rows is M. Each thread block will handle one row.

But how to determine how many blocks to launch. The kernel will be launched with a number of blocks equal to M. Each block processes one row.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a grid of blocks and a number of threads per block. So, for each row, the block will process that row.

So, the kernel's grid is M blocks, each block processes one row.

Within each block, the threads will process the elements of that row. Let's say each thread in the block handles one element in the row. Then, the threads in the block perform a reduction to find the minimum.

But how to handle the threads in the block. Let's say the block has 256 threads. For a row of N elements, the threads will be assigned to each element. But if N is less than the block size, some threads may be idle. So, we need to handle that.

Alternatively, the block can be designed to handle the reduction for the row. For example, the block has a number of threads that can reduce the row's elements.

So, the kernel would look like this:

For each row in the input tensor:

   Initialize the minimum as the first element.

   For each element in the row after the first:

      Compare with the current minimum and update if necessary.

But in Triton, this would be done using a reduction operation. So, for each row, the threads in the block will perform a reduction to find the minimum.

So, the kernel would have:

- A grid of M blocks, each block processes one row.

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in the context of GPUs, especially with Triton.

First, the input tensors are A (M x K) and B (K x N). The result is C (M x N), where each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k. But doing this naively would be too slow, so we need to optimize with shared memory and tiling.

Tiling involves dividing the matrices into smaller blocks (tiles) that fit into shared memory. For each tile, we load the corresponding parts of A and B into shared memory, compute the product, and then store the result back into global memory. The key is to choose the right block size and manage the shared memory efficiently.

So, the steps would be:

1. Determine the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 elements per thread is common. Let's say 32 elements per thread. But I need to check if that's suitable for the problem.

2. The kernel will process each tile of A and B. For each tile, we need to compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B. Each thread will handle one element of the result matrix C.

3. Shared memory is used to store the tiles of A and B. Since each tile is of size (block_size x block_size), we need to calculate how many tiles fit into the shared memory. But the exact size depends on the block size and the number of elements per thread.

Wait, for matrix multiplication, each thread usually handles one element of the result matrix. So, the number of threads per block would be determined by the number of elements in the result matrix. But with tiling, each thread might handle a portion of the tile.

Alternatively, in the standard approach, each thread block processes a tile of A and B. For example, if the block size is 32, then each tile is 32x32. The number of threads per block would be (block_size)^2, but that might not be efficient. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of how many threads are needed per tile.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured so that each thread computes a single element of C. But with tiling, each thread would compute a portion of the tile. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the tile size and how the threads are arranged.

Let me think of the standard approach. For matrix multiplication, each thread block processes a tile of A and B. The number of threads per block is typically (block_size)^2, where block_size is the tile size. For example, if the tile is 32x32, then each block has 32x32 threads. Each thread computes a single element of the result matrix. However, this approach may not be optimal for all cases, but it's a common approach.

But in this case, the problem says to use tile-based computation with shared memory. So the kernel should be structured to load tiles into shared memory, compute the product, and then store the result.

Let me outline the steps:

- The kernel is called with the dimensions M, K, N. The kernel will process each element of C.

- For each thread, it computes the index in C (i, j), but that's not efficient. Instead, we need to process tiles.

Wait, maybe I should structure the kernel to process tiles of A and B. For example, the kernel will iterate over tiles of A and B, compute the product, and accumulate the result into C.

But how to structure the threads? Each thread block would handle a tile of A and a tile of B. The number of threads per block would be determined by the tile size. For example, if the tile size is 32x32, then each block has 32x32 threads. Each thread would compute a single element of the result matrix.

But in that case, the kernel would be structured as follows:

- For each tile of A (size block_size x block_size) and tile of B (block_size x block_size), compute the product and store the result in C.

But how to map the thread indices to the tiles?

Alternatively, the kernel could be structured such that each thread is responsible for computing a single element of C. However, with tiling, the threads would process tiles of A and B, and compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B.

But perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element of C, and use shared memory to load the tiles of A and B. However, that might not be the most efficient way.

Alternatively, the kernel

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through the steps.

First, I remember that matrix multiplication involves computing C = A * B, where A is MxK and B is KxN. The result C will be MxN. But since Triton is a GPU kernel, I need to optimize for memory access patterns and use shared memory to reduce latency.

The key here is to use tile-based computation. So, I should split the matrices into tiles that fit into shared memory. Typically, for matrix multiplication, each tile is a block of size, say, 32x32. But the exact size depends on the hardware and the problem. Let me decide on a block size. Maybe 32x32? Or perhaps 16x16? Wait, the user didn't specify, but I should choose a common block size. Let's go with 32x32 for each tile.

So, the kernel will process elements in tiles. Each thread will handle a portion of the matrix. The threads will load their portion into shared memory, then perform the multiplication.

Now, the input tensors A and B are of shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The output C is [M, N]. But since we're using shared memory, we need to load chunks of A and B into shared memory. For each tile, we'll load a block of A (say, of size TILE_M x TILE_K) and a block of B (TILE_K x TILE_N), then compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B.

Wait, but in matrix multiplication, each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, for each tile, we need to compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B.

But how to structure the threads. Let me think about the threadblock structure. Each threadblock will handle a block of rows in A and columns in B. Wait, maybe each threadblock is responsible for a block of rows in A and a block of columns in B. But I need to structure the threads so that each thread computes a part of the result.

Alternatively, each threadblock can compute a block of the output matrix. Let me think about the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton.

In the standard approach, each threadblock is responsible for computing a block of the output matrix. For example, if the output is MxN, and the threadblock is responsible for a block of size (tile_m, tile_n), then the threads in the block compute the elements in that block.

But for the tile-based approach, each threadblock will load a tile of A and a tile of B into shared memory. Then, each thread in the block computes a portion of the result.

Wait, perhaps I should structure the kernel such that each threadblock handles a block of rows in A and a block of columns in B. For example, each threadblock is responsible for computing a block of size (tile_m, tile_n) in the output matrix. Then, each thread in the block computes a single element of the output matrix.

But how to split the work. Let me think of the kernel parameters. The kernel will take the input tensors A and B, and output tensor C. The kernel is written in Triton, so I need to define the grid and block dimensions.

The main steps for the kernel:

1. Each threadblock is responsible for a block of rows in A and a block of columns in B. The size of the block is determined by the tile size. For example, if the tile size is TILE_M x TILE_K for A and TILE_K x TILE_N for B, then each threadblock handles a block of size TILE_M x TILE_N in the output matrix.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. For matrix multiplication, the standard approach is to split the matrices into tiles. Each tile of A is of size (tile_m, tile_k), and each tile of B is (tile_k, tile_n). Then, each tile of C is (tile_m, tile_n). So, the threadblock would process one tile of A and one tile of B, and compute the corresponding tile of C.

But how to structure the threads. Each thread in the block would compute a single element of C. So, for each element C[i][j], the thread would compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But to do this efficiently, the threads need to access the elements of A and B in a way that allows for coalesced memory access. So, the threads would be organized into groups that can compute the dot product efficiently.

Alternatively, the threads can be arranged in a way that each thread

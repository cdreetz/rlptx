Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to compute C = A * B, where A is MxK and B is KxN. The result C should be MxN. So each element C[i,j] is the sum over k of A[i,k] * B[k,j].

Now, considering how to structure the Triton kernel. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows for efficient parallelism. The key is to partition the computation into blocks that can be processed in parallel.

For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block matrix approach where each block handles a portion of the matrices. But since Triton is a low-level language, I need to think about how to tile the matrices into blocks that can be processed efficiently.

Let me recall that in Triton, each kernel launch is divided into warps, and each warp has multiple threads. The threads can be organized into blocks, and each block can handle a portion of the computation.

In this case, the matrices A and B are of sizes M x K and K x N. The result C is M x N. So, for each element in C, we need to compute the dot product of the i-th row of A and the j-th column of B.

But how to structure this in Triton? Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. So for A, each row is contiguous in memory, and similarly for B.

The key is to determine the block size and how to partition the matrices into blocks. For example, each thread might handle a block of size (block_size, block_size), but I need to make sure that the threads can efficiently access the elements of A and B.

Wait, in matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that allows for efficient memory access. For example, using a block size of 32, and each thread handles a portion of the K dimension. But since K can be large, we need to tile the K dimension into blocks.

Alternatively, for each thread, we can compute a part of the dot product. Let me think about the indices. Let's say each thread is responsible for computing a particular element in the result matrix. But that's not efficient because each element requires a dot product over K elements.

So, perhaps a better approach is to have each thread compute a part of the dot product. For example, if the block size is 32, each thread can handle a chunk of K elements. But how to organize this?

Alternatively, think about the problem as follows: for each row i in A and column j in B, compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, the threads can be organized such that each thread is responsible for a particular k in the dot product. But that's not straightforward.

Wait, maybe I should use the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton. Let me recall that in Triton, for matrix multiplication, the kernel is often structured with threads handling a block of elements in the K dimension. So, each thread computes a part of the sum over k.

For example, each thread is responsible for a certain range of k indices. But how to split the K dimension into blocks. Let's assume that each thread is responsible for a block of size BLOCK_SIZE in the K dimension. Then, for each thread, we can compute the sum over that block.

But then, the number of threads needed would be (M * N) / (BLOCK_SIZE^2), but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, the threads can be arranged in a way that each thread is responsible for a particular i and j, but that would require a lot of threads.

Alternatively, the standard approach is to have each thread compute a part of the dot product. For example, in the case of a matrix multiplication where A is M x K and B is K x N, the kernel can be structured with threads that process a block of size (block_size, block_size) in the K dimension. Each thread would handle a particular k in that block.

But I need to think about the memory layout. For A, each row is contiguous. So, for a given i, the elements A[i, k] are stored in memory as A[i * K + k]. Similarly, for B, each column is contiguous. So, B[k, j] is stored as B[k * N + j].

Wait, no. If B is stored in row-major order, then B[k, j] is stored at position k * N + j. But when you have a K x N matrix, each row is N elements. So for B, the element at row k, column j is B[k * N + j].

But for the matrix multiplication, each element C[i,j

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to compute C = A * B, where A is MxK and B is KxN. The result C should be MxN. So each element C[i,j] is the sum over k of A[i,k] * B[k,j].

In Triton, I need to handle this with a kernel that can efficiently process the matrix multiplication. Let's recall how Triton works. The kernel is divided into blocks, and each thread block processes a portion of the matrices. The key is to choose the right block size and memory access patterns to maximize coalesced access and minimize bank conflicts.

For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to handle a submatrix. Let's think about the dimensions. The first matrix A has shape [M, K], and the second B has [K, N]. The result C is [M, N].

In Triton, each thread block can process a block of rows from A and columns from B. But since K can be large, we need to split the computation into blocks. For example, each thread block might handle a block of size (block_size, block_size), where block_size is chosen to fit into the GPU's registers and shared memory.

Wait, but in matrix multiplication, the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element of the result. However, that's not efficient because it leads to a lot of thread divergence and poor memory access. Instead, we can use a block size that allows each thread block to compute multiple elements in a way that maximizes memory coalescing.

Alternatively, maybe using a block size that allows each thread to handle a submatrix of A and B. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread block can process a 32x32 submatrix of A and B. But I need to think about how to structure the loops.

Let me recall the standard Triton matrix multiplication approach. The kernel usually has three nested loops: one for the rows of A, one for the columns of B, and one for the inner product. However, in Triton, the loops are handled via the kernel's parameters and the thread indices.

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured with each thread block handling a portion of the matrices. For example, each thread block handles a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. But since the matrices are [M, K] and [K, N], the block size needs to be chosen such that the threads can process the inner product efficiently.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to use a block size of 32, and each thread block processes a block of size (block_size, block_size) in A and B. But I need to make sure that the inner product is computed efficiently.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. So for A, each row is contiguous in memory. Similarly for B. The result C is also stored in row-major order.

In Triton, each thread can be assigned a position in the matrix. For example, each thread can compute a single element of C. But that's not efficient. Instead, using a block size that allows each thread block to compute multiple elements in a way that minimizes memory access.

Alternatively, for each thread block, we can compute a block of size (block_size, block_size) in the result matrix. But that requires that the block size is compatible with the dimensions of the input matrices.

Wait, maybe the standard approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to handle a portion of the inner product. For example, each thread block has a certain number of elements in the inner product. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread can compute a part of the inner product.

But I need to think about how to structure the loops. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. The kernel is called with the shapes of A (M, K) and B (K, N), and the result C (M, N).

2. Each thread block is responsible for computing a block of rows in A and columns in B. For example, each thread block processes a block of size (block_size, block_size) in A and B. However, since the inner product is over K elements, the block size for the inner product should be chosen to fit into the registers.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread block compute a block of size (block_size, block_size) in the result matrix. For example, each thread block handles a block of rows in A and columns in B. But since K can be large, the block size for the inner product (the number of elements in the inner product

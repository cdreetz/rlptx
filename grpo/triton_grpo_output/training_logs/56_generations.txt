Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by understanding what's required here.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first tensor is of shape (M, K), and the second is (K, N). The result should be a tensor of shape (M, N). Each element in the result is the sum of the products of elements from the rows of the first matrix and columns of the second matrix.

So, for each element (i, j) in the output, it's the sum over k from 0 to K-1 of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. 

Now, thinking about how to implement this in Triton. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA, but with more abstraction. The key is to structure the kernel to efficiently use the GPU's parallelism.

First, I need to decide on the memory layout. The input tensors are stored in row-major order, which is standard for most GPU implementations. So, for the first matrix A (M, K), each row is stored contiguously. Similarly for B (K, N), each row is contiguous.

But in matrix multiplication, the inner loop is over the K dimension. So, for each element in the output, we need to iterate over K, multiply the corresponding elements from A and B, and accumulate the sum.

In Triton, the kernel is written with a grid and a block structure. The standard approach is to use a block size that's a power of two, like 256. But I need to think about how to partition the problem.

Each thread in the kernel can be responsible for computing a single element in the output matrix. However, this approach might not be efficient because each thread would have to do K operations, which could be expensive if K is large. But given that Triton is optimized for such operations, maybe it's manageable.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a more efficient approach by using shared memory. But for simplicity, perhaps start with the basic approach and then think about optimizations.

Let me outline the steps:

1. The kernel will take the two input tensors A and B, and the output tensor C.
2. Each thread computes one element of C, which is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].
3. The thread index can be determined by the block and thread indices. For example, each thread is responsible for a specific (i, j) pair in the output matrix.

But wait, how to map the thread indices to (i, j)? If the kernel is designed to compute all elements of C, then the thread index can be used to determine i and j. For example, if the kernel is launched with a grid of size (M, N), then each thread in the grid would compute C[i][j].

But in Triton, the kernel is launched with a grid of (num_blocks_m, num_blocks_n), and each block has a certain number of threads. So, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each block handles a certain range of rows (i) and columns (j). But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, each thread can compute a single element (i, j), where i is determined by the thread's row in the block, and j by the column in the block. However, this depends on the block size.

Let me think about the block size. Let's say each block has BLOCK_SIZE = 256 threads. Then, for each block, we can have multiple threads working on different (i, j) pairs. But how to split the work?

Alternatively, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element (i, j), and the kernel is launched with a grid that has M rows and N columns. But that might not be efficient because the number of threads could be very large.

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured to compute each element (i, j) in the output matrix. For that, the thread index can be used to determine i and j. For example, if the kernel is launched with a grid of size (M, N), then each thread is responsible for (i, j) = (thread_idx_row, thread_idx_col). But that's not how Triton works. Triton's grid is determined by the number of blocks, and each block has a certain number of threads.

So, perhaps the kernel is designed such that each block handles a certain number of rows (i) and columns (j). But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, think about the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton. The standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element of the output matrix, and the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a specific (i, j) pair. The threads are arranged in a grid where each block handles a certain number of rows and

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the operation is matrix multiplication, so the result should be a tensor of shape [M, N]. Each element in the resulting matrix is the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix. 

For Triton, I need to figure out how to structure the kernel. The key is to use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency. The standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to split the matrices into blocks that fit into shared memory. 

Let me recall the standard approach. For each block of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), we load the corresponding rows and columns into shared memory. Then, compute the dot product. But since the matrices are [M, K] and [K, N], I need to make sure that the block sizes are chosen appropriately. 

The first matrix is M x K, and the second is K x N. So, for each element in the result (i, j), we compute sum_{k} A[i][k] * B[k][j]. 

In the kernel, each thread will handle a specific element in the result. But to optimize, we can have each thread compute a part of the dot product. However, since the matrices are stored in row-major order, I need to make sure that the threads access the correct elements.

Wait, in Triton, the kernel is typically written with a loop over the rows and columns of the result. Each thread computes one element. But for efficiency, we can use a block of threads that compute a block of the result. 

But given that the matrices are [M, K] and [K, N], the block size for the first matrix (M) and the second matrix (N) would need to be considered. Let me think about the block size. 

Let's assume that each thread handles a block of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). For the first matrix (M x K), each thread would load a row of size K into shared memory. For the second matrix (K x N), each thread would load a column of size K into shared memory. Then, the dot product is computed by multiplying the elements of the row and column and summing them up. 

But wait, the second matrix is K x N. So for each column j in the result, we need to access the column j of the second matrix. However, in the standard approach, the second matrix is transposed. So maybe the second matrix is stored as a column-major format. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should transpose the second matrix in the kernel. But in Triton, the kernel can't transpose the matrix, so I need to handle it in the code. 

Wait, no. The second matrix is K x N. For each element in the result (i,j), we need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So for each thread, if we are computing (i,j), then the first matrix's row is A[i], and the second matrix's column is B[:,j]. 

So, for the second matrix, each column j is accessed. So, in the kernel, for each thread, we need to load the row of A and the column of B. 

But how to do that efficiently. 

Let me think about the shared memory. For the first matrix (M x K), each block of threads will handle a block of rows. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread in the block handles a row of the first matrix. Wait, no. Maybe the block size is chosen such that each thread can handle a certain number of elements. 

Alternatively, the standard approach is to use a block size of 32, and for each thread, compute a part of the dot product. For example, each thread computes a portion of the sum. But that might not be efficient. 

Alternatively, for the first matrix, each thread is responsible for a row, and for the second matrix, each thread is responsible for a column. But that would require that each thread can access the entire row of the first matrix and the entire column of the second matrix. 

But in that case, the threads would need to load the entire row and column into shared memory. However, if the row is of size K, and the column is of size K, then for each thread, the shared memory would need to hold K elements. 

But if K is larger than the block size, then this approach might not be efficient. So, perhaps the block size is chosen such that the number of elements in the row and column is a multiple of the block size. 

Alternatively, the standard approach is to split the matrices into blocks of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). For example, the first matrix is split

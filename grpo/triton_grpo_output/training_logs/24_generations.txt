Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through the steps.

First, I remember that matrix multiplication involves computing each element of the resulting matrix as the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix. Since we're using shared memory, the idea is to load tiles of the matrices into shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.

So, the input tensors are A (M, K) and B (K, N). The output tensor C will be (M, N). Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

For tile-based computation, I'll divide the matrices into blocks (tiles) of size, say, TILE_M x TILE_K for matrix A and TILE_K x TILE_N for matrix B. But since the matrices are stored in row-major order, I need to handle the indices correctly.

The kernel should process each element of C. For each element, we need to compute the dot product of the corresponding row from A and column from B. However, using shared memory, we can load a block of A and B into shared memory, compute the dot product for that block, and then write the result to C.

Wait, but how do we handle the tiles? Let me think. For each tile in A (size TILE_M x TILE_K), and each tile in B (size TILE_K x TILE_N), the dot product for each element in C would involve multiplying the corresponding elements from the tiles and summing them up. But since the tiles are of size TILE_K, the number of elements in the dot product would be TILE_K, which is manageable.

So, the kernel will have to loop over the elements of C. For each element (i, j), we need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. But with shared memory, we can load the relevant rows of A and columns of B into shared memory, then compute the sum.

But how to structure the loops? The standard approach is to have a loop over the rows of A, and for each row, loop over the columns of B. But with shared memory, we need to load the tiles.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. So, for matrix A, each row is contiguous in memory. Similarly for B.

In the kernel, each thread will handle a specific element of C. But to use shared memory, we need to load a block of A and B into shared memory. For example, each thread block will process a block of rows from A and columns from B.

Wait, maybe I should structure the kernel such that each thread block handles a block of rows in A and a block of columns in B. But that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, each thread could handle a specific element in C, but with shared memory, we need to load the relevant tiles.

Alternatively, the kernel could be structured with two loops: one over the rows of A (i) and one over the columns of B (j). For each i and j, compute the dot product. But that would be O(M*N*K) operations, which is not efficient. So, instead, we need to compute the dot product in blocks.

Ah, right. The tile-based approach would involve dividing the matrices into tiles. For example, each tile of A is of size TILE_M x TILE_K, and each tile of B is TILE_K x TILE_N. Then, for each tile in A and B, compute the corresponding part of C.

But how to map this to the threads? Each thread block would handle a block of rows in A and a block of columns in B. However, the exact mapping depends on the tile size.

Alternatively, each thread block could be responsible for computing a block of C. For example, if the tile size is TILE_M x TILE_N, then each thread block computes a TILE_M x TILE_N block of C. But that would require that the tiles of A and B are compatible with the tile size.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread block compute a block of C. Let me think. Let's say the tile size is TILE_M x TILE_K for A and TILE_K x TILE_N for B. Then, the number of tiles in A would be ceil(M / TILE_M) and similarly for B. But this might be complicated.

Alternatively, the kernel could be structured with two loops: one over the rows of A (i) and one over the columns of B (j). For each i and j, compute the dot product. But to do this efficiently with shared memory, each thread would load a block of A and B into shared memory, and compute the dot product for that block.

But how to do that

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in the context of GPU kernels, especially with Triton.

First, the problem is to compute C = A * B, where A is MxK and B is KxN. The result C will be MxN. The standard approach for matrix multiplication on GPUs is to use shared memory to store tiles of the matrices, which helps reduce memory latency and improve performance.

So, the steps I need to take are:

1. **Understand the GPU operations needed**: For each element in the resulting matrix C, we need to compute the sum of products of elements from the corresponding rows of A and columns of B. Since we're using tile-based computation, we'll process small blocks (tiles) of the matrices.

2. **Input/Output Tensor Shapes and Memory Layout**: The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order (assuming standard memory layout). The output tensor C will be MxN. The shared memory will hold tiles of A and B, which are smaller than the original matrices.

3. **Optimal Block Sizes and Memory Access Patterns**: The block size should be chosen to maximize memory bandwidth and minimize bank conflicts. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 elements is used. The tiles in shared memory should be of size (block_size, block_size), which allows for efficient computation.

4. **Edge Cases with Masking**: When the matrices are not perfectly divisible by the block size, there might be leftover elements. These need to be handled properly. Also, when accessing elements that are out of bounds, we need to use masks to avoid invalid accesses.

Now, let's think about the specifics. The kernel will be written in Triton, which is a high-level GPU programming language. The kernel will be launched with a grid of threads, each responsible for computing a specific element in the result matrix.

The shared memory will be used to store tiles of A and B. Each thread will compute a part of the result. The key steps are:

- Load the tiles of A and B into shared memory.
- Compute the dot product of the corresponding row from A and column from B.
- Store the result in the output tensor.

But wait, in matrix multiplication, each thread in the block typically computes one element of the result. However, with tile-based computation, the block size is larger, and each thread might be part of a group that computes a tile.

Alternatively, the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element of the result. However, with shared memory, we can load a tile of A and a tile of B into shared memory, then compute the dot product of the corresponding row and column. But this requires that the tiles are of size that allows for efficient computation.

Wait, maybe I should structure the kernel such that each thread computes a single element of the result. Let me think again.

In the standard matrix multiplication kernel, each thread computes one element of the result. The threads are organized into blocks, and each block handles a portion of the matrix. However, with shared memory, we can load a tile of A and a tile of B into shared memory, which allows for more efficient computation.

But for this problem, the user specified tile-based computation with shared memory. So perhaps the approach is to split the matrices into tiles, and each thread computes a part of the dot product.

But I need to make sure that the kernel is efficient. Let's think about the parameters.

Let me define the block size. Let's say the block size is 32. Each thread in the block will handle a portion of the computation. However, for matrix multiplication, the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element, but with shared memory, we can load tiles of A and B into shared memory.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread computes a single element, but the shared memory is used to store a tile of A and a tile of B. However, for that, the block size needs to be such that the threads can access the tiles.

Alternatively, the kernel could be structured with each thread computing a part of the dot product. For example, each thread computes a certain number of elements in the dot product, which is then accumulated.

But I think the standard approach for Triton is to have each thread compute a single element of the result. So let's proceed with that.

Let me outline the steps for each thread:

1. Determine the row and column in the result matrix that the thread is responsible for. For example, if the thread index is (i, j), then it computes C[i][j].

2. The thread needs to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

3. To compute this efficiently, the

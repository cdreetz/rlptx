Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum over the N dimension, so each row in the 2D tensor (each row has N elements) needs to be summed. So for each row, we add up all the elements in that row.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding row.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels typically use a grid and block structure. For this problem, each block can handle a certain number of rows. Let's say each block processes a few rows. The BLOCK_SIZE is a parameter that I can set. Since we're processing rows, each thread in the block can handle a single element in a row. Wait, but if each thread is responsible for a single element, then for each row, there are N elements. But if the block size is, say, 128, then each block can process 128 elements. But since each row has N elements, maybe the block size should be set to handle multiple elements per thread. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of how many threads per block can process the elements in a row.

Alternatively, since the reduction is along the last dimension (N), each row is processed independently. So for each row, we need to sum all N elements. So for each row, the threads in a block can work together to compute the sum. But how to structure that.

Wait, maybe the approach is to have each thread process a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction across the threads in the block. So for each row, the threads in the block will add up their elements, and then the block's result is the sum for that row.

But how to handle the rows. Let's think about the grid. The grid will have as many blocks as there are rows (M), but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe the grid is determined by the number of rows, and each block processes a single row. But if the number of rows is large, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, perhaps each block processes multiple rows, but that could complicate the reduction.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element in a row, and then the threads in the block reduce their values to get the sum for that row. But then, for each row, the threads in the block would have to process all N elements. However, if the block size is larger than N, then each block would process multiple rows. Hmm, maybe I need to think of the kernel as processing each row independently.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is designed such that each block processes a single row. So for each row, the block's threads process the elements in that row and sum them. But how to structure that.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensor is [M, N], so each row is of length N. The output is [M], each element is the sum of the row.

In Triton, the kernel is written with a grid of blocks, each block processing a certain range of elements. For a 2D tensor, perhaps the kernel is structured to process each row, and for each row, the threads in the block process the elements in that row.

So, for each row i in 0..M-1, we need to sum the elements in that row. The kernel should be able to process each row in parallel.

So, the grid is determined by the number of rows. Each block processes one row. But if the number of rows is large, this might not be efficient. However, since the kernel is for a sum reduction, perhaps it's better to have each block process a row, and then each block's threads process the elements in that row.

But how to structure the threads. Let's say each block has a certain number of threads, say, BLOCK_SIZE. For a row of N elements, each thread in the block would process a single element. Then, the threads in the block would sum their elements. But if the number of threads per block is less than N, then each block would need to process multiple elements. Wait, but for each row, the number of elements is N. So, for a row, if the block has T threads, then each thread would take care of a certain element. Then, the block would sum all the elements in the row.

But how to handle this in Triton. Let's think about the kernel parameters. The kernel will have a grid of blocks, each block processes a single row. The number of blocks is M. Each block has a certain number

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum each column of the tensor. So for each column (which is along the N dimension), we need to add up all the elements in that column. Since it's a 2D tensor, the input is M rows and N columns. The output should be a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the sum of the corresponding column.

Next, input and output shapes. The input tensor has shape [M, N], and the output will be [M]. The memory layout is important here. The input is stored in a 2D grid, so each row is contiguous in memory. For the kernel, I'll need to process each column, so the kernel should iterate over each column and sum the elements in that column.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels use warps and threads per warp. A common approach is to use a block size that's a multiple of the warp size (32). Let's say we use 128 threads per block. Each thread will handle a specific element in the tensor. But since we're summing columns, maybe each thread can handle a single element, and then we can reduce across threads. Wait, but if each thread is responsible for a single element, then for each column, we need to sum all the elements in that column. However, with a block size of 128, each block can handle a column. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, for each column, we can have multiple threads processing different elements in that column. But since the columns are independent, maybe each thread can process a single element in a column. But how to organize this.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a specific column. Wait, but the sum is along the last dimension (N), so each column is summed. So for each column index j (from 0 to N-1), we need to sum all elements in that column. But the kernel needs to process all columns. However, the output is of size M, so perhaps each output element is the sum of a column. Wait, no. Wait, the input is [M, N], so each column is of size M. The sum along the last dimension (N) would be summing each column. Wait, no. Wait, the last dimension is N, so summing along the last dimension would mean for each row, summing across the columns? Wait, no. Wait, the sum reduction along the last dimension (N) would be for each element in the first dimension (M), summing across the N elements. Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, the tensor is [M, N]. So, for example, if M=4 and N=5, the tensor is 4 rows and 5 columns. Summing along the last dimension (N) would mean for each row, summing across the 5 columns. Wait, but that would give a 1D tensor of size M. Wait, no. Wait, summing along the last dimension (N) would collapse that dimension. So the output would be [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding row. Wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm confused here.

Wait, the problem says "sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]". So the last dimension is N. So the sum is over the N dimension. So for each element in the first dimension (M), we sum across the N elements. So for example, if the tensor is [M, N], then the sum along the last dimension would be a tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding row. Wait, but that's summing across columns for each row. So for each row, sum all elements in that row. So the output is a 1D tensor of size M, each element is the sum of the row.

Wait, but the user said "sum reduction along the last dimension". So if the tensor is [M, N], then the last dimension is N. So summing along that dimension would collapse it to [M], which is correct.

So the kernel needs to compute for each row (i.e., each element in the first dimension), the sum of all elements in that row. So for each row i, sum over j from 0 to N-1 of tensor[i][j].

So the kernel needs to process each row, sum all elements in that row.

But how to structure the kernel. Let's think about the kernel's threads. Each thread can be responsible for a specific element in the tensor. But since each row has N elements, and the

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. So, the input is a 2D tensor, and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding row in the input.

First, I need to figure out what GPU operations are needed. Since we're doing a sum reduction along the last dimension, each thread should be responsible for summing a particular row. But wait, in Triton, threads are typically organized into warps, and each thread might handle a specific element. However, for a sum reduction, we need to accumulate values, so maybe we need to use a reduction pattern where threads in a warp combine their results.

Wait, but in this case, each row is independent. So perhaps each thread can handle a single element in the row, and then we can reduce across the threads in the warp. But since the rows are independent, maybe we can process each row in parallel. However, the problem is that each row has N elements, and we need to sum them. So for each row, we need to sum all N elements.

So, the approach would be: for each row (i), each thread in the warp handles a certain element in that row. Then, the threads in the warp reduce their partial sums to get the total sum for that row.

But how to structure this? Let's think about the thread indices. Let's say we have M rows. Each row has N elements. So, for each row i, we need to process N elements. But how to distribute the elements across threads?

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then the threads in the warp combine their results. But for that, we need to have a way to assign each thread to a specific element in the row. However, since N can be large, we need to make sure that the number of threads per row is sufficient to process all elements.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is launched with a certain number of blocks and threads per block. So, perhaps we need to compute how many threads per block are needed. For example, if each block processes a row, then the number of threads per block would be N. But if N is large, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread process a single element in the row, and then the threads in the warp reduce their results.

But for a sum reduction along the last dimension, the standard approach is to have each thread handle a single element, and then perform a reduction across the threads. However, since each row is independent, maybe we can process each row in parallel.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is designed such that each thread handles a single element in the row, and then the threads in the warp combine their results. But how to handle the rows?

Let me think. Suppose the input tensor is of shape [M, N], and we want to compute the sum along the last dimension. So, for each row i, the sum is sum_{j=0}^{N-1} input[i][j].

So, the kernel needs to process each row, and for each row, sum all elements. So, the kernel should iterate over each row, and for each row, sum all elements in that row.

But how to structure this in Triton? Let's consider the thread index. Let's say that each thread is responsible for a single element in a row. But how to assign which row each thread is responsible for?

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is assigned to a specific row, and then processes all elements in that row. But that might not be efficient if the number of threads per row is large.

Wait, maybe the kernel is designed with the following approach:

- Each thread is assigned to a specific row i. Then, for that row, the thread processes all elements in that row. But that would require each thread to process N elements, which could be inefficient if N is large.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is designed with the following structure:

- The kernel is launched with a certain number of blocks, each block processing a single row. Each block has a certain number of threads, which process the elements in that row. Then, the threads in the block reduce their results to get the sum for the row.

But how to structure this? Let's think about the block and thread indices. Let's say that each block is responsible for a single row. Then, the number of blocks is M. Each block has a certain number of threads, say, BLOCK_SIZE. Each thread in the block would process a single element in the row. Then, the threads in the block would reduce their partial sums to get the total sum for the row.

But how to handle the elements in the row? For example, for a row i, the elements

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum each column of the 2D tensor. So for each column (which is along the N dimension), I need to add up all the elements in that column. The output should be a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the sum of the corresponding column.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. The output will be a 1D tensor of size M. The memory layout is important here. Since it's a 2D tensor, the elements are stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. For a tensor with shape [M, N], the element at row i, column j is stored at position i*N + j. But since we're summing along the last dimension (columns), each column is a vertical slice. So for each column j, we need to sum all elements from row 0 to M-1 in that column.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels use warps and threads per warp. The optimal block size depends on the problem. Since we're processing columns, perhaps each thread can handle a single column. But since each column has M elements, and each thread can process a single element, maybe we need to have threads per column. Wait, but if we have M elements per column, and each thread can process one element, then for each column, we need M threads. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread handle a block of elements in the column. But since the sum is over all elements in the column, perhaps each thread can process a single element, and then they reduce the sum.

Wait, but in a 2D tensor, each column is M elements. So for each column j, we need to sum all elements in that column. So the kernel needs to iterate over each column, and for each column, sum all the elements in that column.

But how to structure the threads. Let's think about the threads per block. Suppose we have a block size of, say, 1024. Each thread can handle a single column. But for each column, the thread needs to read all M elements. But that would be too much if M is large. Alternatively, maybe the threads are arranged in a way that each thread handles a portion of the column. But since the sum is over all elements, perhaps we need to have a reduction step.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single column. For each column, the thread reads all the elements in that column and sums them. But that would require each thread to process M elements, which could be inefficient if M is large. However, if the column is stored in contiguous memory, then for a column j, the elements are at positions j, j + N, j + 2*N, ..., j + (M-1)*N. Wait, no. Wait, in a 2D tensor with shape [M, N], the element at row i, column j is stored at index i*N + j. So for column j, the elements are at positions (0*N + j), (1*N + j), ..., (M-1)*N + j. So for column j, the elements are in positions j, j + N, j + 2N, etc. So each element in the column is spaced N apart in memory.

So for a given column j, the elements are stored at positions j + i*N for i from 0 to M-1. So if a thread is responsible for column j, it needs to read M elements, each at positions j + i*N. But if M is large, that's a lot of memory accesses. However, in Triton, each thread can have a loop over the elements in the column. But that would be O(M) per thread, which might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can use a reduction across the rows for each column.

Wait, but the problem is that for each column, the sum is over all elements. So perhaps the kernel is structured as follows: for each column j, we have a thread that computes the sum of that column. But how to do that efficiently.

Alternatively, think of the kernel as processing each column in parallel. Each thread is assigned a column j. Then, for that column, the thread needs to sum all the elements in that column. However, if M is large, then each thread would need to loop through M elements, which is O(M) per thread. That's not efficient. But perhaps the kernel is designed for small M, or maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed

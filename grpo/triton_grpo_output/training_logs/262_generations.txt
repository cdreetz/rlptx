Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum each column of the tensor. So for each column (which is along the N dimension), we need to add up all the elements in that column. The input is a 2D tensor with M rows and N columns. The output should be a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the sum of the corresponding column.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The input is [M, N], and the output is [M]. The memory layout is probably row-major, so each row is contiguous in memory. For a 2D tensor, the elements are stored as [0, 0], [0, 1], ..., [0, N-1], [1, 0], etc.

Now, optimal block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels use warps and threads per warp. For a sum reduction, a common approach is to have each thread handle a portion of the data. Since we're summing along the last dimension (columns), each thread should process a specific column. But how to organize the threads?

Let me think: For each column, we need to sum all the elements in that column. So, for a given column index, the elements are at positions (i, col) for i from 0 to M-1. But if we have multiple threads working on the same column, we can do a reduction. However, since the problem is to sum all elements in a column, maybe each thread can take responsibility for a single element in the column and then perform a reduction.

Wait, but if we have multiple threads per column, we can do a reduction. But how to structure the threads. Let's think about the grid and block structure. The kernel will have a grid of threads, each responsible for a column. But how to split the columns among the threads?

Alternatively, for each column, we can have multiple threads that compute the sum. But that might not be efficient. Maybe a better approach is to have each thread handle a single element in the column, and then perform a reduction across the threads for that column. However, since the sum is along the entire column, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element, and then the threads in the same block perform a reduction to get the sum for that column.

Wait, but in a 2D tensor, each column has M elements. So for a column, there are M elements. If we have a block size of, say, 128, then each block can handle a certain number of elements in the column. But how to split the elements across threads in the block.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the column. Then, the threads in the block perform a reduction to sum all the elements in the column. However, this would require that each thread has a unique element in the column. But how to map the threads to the elements.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed to process each column in parallel. For example, each thread is assigned a column index, and then processes all elements in that column. But that would require each thread to process M elements, which might be inefficient if M is large.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to have each thread handle a single element in the column, and then perform a reduction across the threads in the block to sum the elements. But how to organize that.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensor is stored in row-major order. So for a column j, the elements are at positions (i, j) for i from 0 to M-1. The linear index for element (i, j) is i * N + j. So, for a given column j, the elements are at positions j, j + N, j + 2*N, ..., j + (M-1)*N.

So, for a given thread, if it's responsible for a specific column j, it can iterate over all the elements in that column. But that would require that each thread has a way to access all elements in the column. However, if the column is large (M is large), then each thread would have to process many elements, which could be inefficient.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is designed to process each column in a way that each thread is responsible for a single element in the column, and then the threads in the block perform a reduction. But how to do that.

Wait, maybe the kernel is structured with each thread handling a single element in the column, and then the threads in the block perform a reduction to get the sum for that column. However, since the column has M elements, if the block has multiple threads, each thread can take responsibility for a subset of the elements.

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum over the last dimension, which is N. So for each row in the tensor (each row is of length N), we need to sum all the elements. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding row.

Next, input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N], and the output is a 1D tensor with shape [M]. The memory layout is probably row-major, which is standard for tensors. So each row is contiguous in memory.

Now, optimal block sizes and memory access patterns. Since we're processing each row, each block can handle one row. But since each row has N elements, the block size should be chosen to efficiently process these elements. However, since N can be large, maybe we can use a block size that's a multiple of the warp size (32). But since we're summing all elements in a row, perhaps each thread in the block can handle a portion of the row. Wait, but if each thread is responsible for a single element, then the block size would be N, but that's not efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread process a single element, but that would require each thread to load an element from the input tensor and accumulate the sum. But for large N, this could be slow. Alternatively, maybe we can use a block size that's a multiple of the warp size, and have each thread in the block handle a chunk of the row. But since the sum is over all elements, perhaps it's better to have each thread handle a single element, but with proper memory access patterns.

Wait, but for a 2D tensor, the input is stored as [M, N], so each row is contiguous. So for a given row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j for j from 0 to N-1. So for each row, the threads can process each element in that row.

But how to structure the kernel. Let's think about the kernel parameters. The kernel needs to take the input tensor, the output tensor, and the dimensions M and N. The kernel will iterate over each row, and for each row, sum all elements.

So the kernel will have a loop over rows, and for each row, a loop over the elements. But in Triton, we can't have nested loops directly. Instead, we can use a single loop over the elements, but with some way to group them by row.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a block size that's compatible with the number of rows. Let's think about the block size. Let's say each block handles one row. Then, the number of blocks is M. Each block will process the elements of that row. But how to do that in Triton.

Wait, in Triton, each thread in a block can process a single element. So for a row i, the threads in the block would process elements j from 0 to N-1. But if the block size is larger than N, then some threads would be idle. Alternatively, we can have each thread process a single element, and the block size is set to the number of elements per row. But that's not efficient if N is large. Alternatively, maybe we can use a block size that's a multiple of the warp size, and have each thread in the block handle a single element. But that would require that the number of threads per block is equal to N. However, if N is large, that's not efficient. So perhaps we need to find a way to process the elements in a way that's efficient.

Wait, but for sum reduction, perhaps the optimal approach is to have each thread process a single element, and accumulate the sum. But for that, each thread would need to load the element from the input tensor, add it to a shared sum, and then write the sum to the output tensor.

But how to handle this in Triton. Let me think. The kernel will have a loop over the rows. For each row, the threads in the block will process each element in that row. So for each row i, the threads in the block will compute the sum of elements in that row.

But how to structure the kernel. Let's consider that each thread in the block is responsible for a single element in the row. So for row i, the thread index within the block (let's say, tid) would correspond to the element j = tid. Then, the position in the input tensor is i * N + j. But since the input tensor is a 2D tensor, perhaps it's stored as a 1D array, so the index is i * N

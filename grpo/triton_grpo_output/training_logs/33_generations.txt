Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by understanding what's required here.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first tensor is of shape (M, K), and the second is (K, N). The result should be a tensor of shape (M, N). Each element in the output is the sum of the products of elements from the corresponding row of the first matrix and column of the second matrix.

Now, thinking about how to implement this in Triton. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA, but with more flexibility and higher-level abstractions. The key is to structure the kernel to efficiently use the GPU's resources, like memory access patterns and thread blocks.

Let me recall the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton. Typically, you split the problem into blocks. For each block, you process a submatrix of the input matrices. The common approach is to use a block size that allows for efficient memory access, often using a tile size like 32x32 or 16x16, depending on the hardware.

In this case, the matrices are (M, K) and (K, N). The output is (M, N). So, for each element (i, j) in the output, we need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. 

But in Triton, we need to structure the threads such that each thread computes a part of this sum. However, since each thread can only compute one element of the output, we need to find a way to compute multiple elements efficiently.

Wait, maybe I should think about the thread block structure. Each thread block can handle a block of rows and columns. For example, each thread block could handle a block of size (block_rows, block_cols) in the output matrix. But how does that translate to the input matrices?

Alternatively, perhaps each thread is responsible for computing a single element of the output. But that would be inefficient because each element requires K operations (summing over K terms). However, with proper memory access patterns, maybe we can optimize this.

Wait, but in Triton, the standard approach for matrix multiplication is to use a tile-based approach. For example, using a block size of 32x32, and each thread block handles a block of rows and columns. Each thread in the block computes a part of the product.

But for this problem, since the input matrices are (M, K) and (K, N), the output is (M, N). So, for each row in the first matrix (M rows) and each column in the second matrix (N columns), we need to compute the sum over K elements.

So, perhaps the threads are arranged such that each thread computes a single element of the output. However, that would require each thread to perform K multiplications and adds, which might be too slow. So, we need to find a way to compute multiple elements in parallel.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a block size that allows for computing multiple elements in a single thread block. For example, if the block size is 32x32, then each thread block can compute a block of (block_rows, block_cols) elements in the output. But how to map this to the input matrices?

Alternatively, think of the problem in terms of the two input matrices. The first matrix (A) has dimensions (M, K), and the second (B) has (K, N). The output is (M, N). So, each element in the output is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

In Triton, the kernel would need to process each element of the output. However, for efficiency, we need to ensure that the memory access patterns are coalesced. That is, each thread should access consecutive elements in memory.

So, the approach would be:

- For each thread, compute a single element of the output matrix.
- The thread's index (i, j) in the output matrix determines which row and column in the input matrices it's working on.
- For each element (i, j), the thread needs to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But this approach would require each thread to iterate over K elements, which could be slow. However, with proper memory access, maybe we can optimize this.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written in a way that each thread can handle a part of the computation. So, for each thread, we can compute a single element of the output. But to do that, the thread needs to access the corresponding elements of A and B.

So, the steps for the kernel would be:

1. Determine the indices for the output element (i, j) that the

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is to compute C = A * B, where A is MxK and B is KxN. The result C should be MxN. So each element C[i,j] is the sum over k of A[i,k] * B[k,j].

In Triton, I need to handle this with a kernel that can efficiently compute this. The key is to structure the kernel to process each element of the resulting matrix.

Let me recall how matrix multiplication is done in Triton. Typically, each thread handles one element of the result. But for efficiency, we need to optimize memory access patterns. Since A is MxK and B is KxN, the threads will need to access elements of A and B in a way that minimizes bank conflicts and maximizes coalesced access.

The kernel will have to loop over the K dimension, which is the common dimension between A and B. Each thread will compute one element of C by summing over k.

Now, considering the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are likely stored in row-major order. So for A, each row is contiguous in memory. Similarly for B.

But in Triton, the kernel needs to know the strides of the tensors. So the kernel will take the pointers to A and B, along with their strides, and compute the indices accordingly.

Let me think about the parameters. The kernel needs to know the dimensions M, K, N. Also, the strides of the input tensors. So the kernel function will have parameters for the pointers to A and B, their strides, and the output pointer for C.

But in Triton, the kernel is written in a way that each thread handles one element. So the kernel will have a loop over the K dimension. Each thread will compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

Wait, but in Triton, threads are usually arranged in blocks. So maybe the kernel is structured such that each block handles a certain range of i and j. But for matrix multiplication, it's common to have each thread compute one element of C. However, for large K, this might be inefficient. But given that Triton is optimized for this, perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element.

But how to structure the threads? Let's think about the grid and block dimensions. The grid size would be determined by the number of elements in C, which is M*N. However, that's not efficient. Instead, maybe we can have each block handle a certain number of rows and columns. But for simplicity, perhaps the kernel is written to have each thread compute one element of C, with the thread index i and j.

Wait, but in matrix multiplication, each thread is responsible for a single element of the result. So the kernel will have a loop over the K dimension, and for each k, multiply A[i][k] and B[k][j], then accumulate the sum.

But how to map the thread index to i and j? Let's assume that the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single (i,j) pair. Then, the thread index in the block can be used to determine i and j. However, for a grid of size M*N, that's a lot of threads, but Triton can handle that.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured with each block handling a certain number of rows and columns. But for simplicity, perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element.

So, the kernel will have parameters for the pointers to A, B, and C, along with their strides. The kernel will loop over the K dimension, and for each k, compute the product and accumulate.

But how to handle the indices. Let me think: For a given i and j, the thread needs to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

So, the kernel will have variables i and j, which are the row and column indices of the result. Then, for each k in 0 to K-1, multiply A[i][k] and B[k][j], and add to C[i][j].

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the K dimension. However, the kernel must be written in a way that each thread handles one (i,j) pair, and loops over k.

But how to determine i and j for each thread? Let's think about the grid and block dimensions. Let's say that the kernel is launched with a grid of size (M, N), and each block has a single thread. Then, each thread would have i = thread_idx[0], j = thread_idx[1]. But that's not efficient for large M and N, but perhaps for the sake of simplicity,

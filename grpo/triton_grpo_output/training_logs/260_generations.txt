Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the min reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the minimum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor). So, for each row (each M element), I need to find the minimum of the N elements in that row.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Now, considering the memory layout. The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. The output tensor will be a 1D array where each element corresponds to a row's minimum.

Optimal block sizes and memory access patterns. Since we're processing each row independently, each block can handle one row. But since each row has N elements, the block size should be chosen to efficiently process N elements. However, since N can vary, maybe using a dynamic block size isn't possible. Alternatively, we can use a block size that's a power of two, but maybe for simplicity, let's use a block size of 256, which is a common choice for Triton kernels. But wait, since each row has N elements, the number of threads per block would be N, but that might not be efficient if N is large. Alternatively, maybe we can process each row in a way that each thread handles a single element, but that would require a lot of threads. Alternatively, perhaps we can use a block size that's a power of two, and process the elements in a way that each thread handles a chunk of elements. But since we need to find the minimum, maybe a better approach is to have each thread handle a single element and compare with the current minimum.

Wait, for each row, the minimum can be computed by having each thread in the block process a single element. For example, if there are N elements in a row, and each thread handles one element, then the number of threads per block would be N. But if N is large, say 1024, then each block would need 1024 threads, which might be possible. However, in Triton, the number of threads per block is determined by the block size. So, perhaps we can use a block size of 256, and for each row, we process elements in chunks of 256. But that might complicate the logic. Alternatively, maybe we can use a block size that's a power of two, and for each row, each thread processes a single element, and then the threads compare their values to find the minimum.

Wait, but how to handle the case where the number of elements in a row (N) is not a multiple of the block size. So, for each row, we need to process all N elements. So, for each row, the number of threads per block would be the number of elements in the row. But that might not be efficient if N is large. Alternatively, perhaps we can use a block size that's a power of two, and for each row, we process the elements in a way that each thread handles a single element, and then the threads compare their values. But how to do that in Triton.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a block size of 256, and for each row, each thread handles a single element. So, for a row with N elements, the number of threads per block would be N. But if N is larger than 256, then multiple blocks would be needed. However, in Triton, the kernel is launched with a certain number of blocks, so perhaps the kernel is designed to process each row with a certain number of threads per block. Wait, but the kernel is written to process each row, so maybe the kernel is written to process each row in parallel, with each thread handling a single element in the row.

But how to structure this. Let me think.

The kernel needs to process each row. For each row, we need to find the minimum of N elements. So, for each row, the kernel will process all elements in that row. So, the kernel's logic would be:

For each row i in 0..M-1:
   current_min = infinity
   for each element j in 0..N-1:
      if tensor[i][j] < current_min:
          current_min = tensor[i][j]
   output[i] = current_min

But how to implement this in Triton. Since Triton is a parallel programming model, the kernel needs to be written in a way that each thread handles a part of the computation.

So, for each row, we can have

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the min reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations required. The task is to find the minimum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor). So for each row (each M element), I need to find the minimum of the N elements in that row.

Next, input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output will be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Now, considering the memory layout. The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. For each row, I need to process all N elements. The output tensor will have one element per row.

Optimal block sizes and memory access patterns. Since each row has N elements, I should process each row in a block. The block size should be chosen to maximize memory coalescing. For example, if N is large, using a block size that's a multiple of the warp size (32) would be efficient. But since N can vary, maybe using a dynamic block size based on the number of elements per row. However, in Triton, the kernel is launched with a specific number of blocks and threads per block. So perhaps I can set the block size to a value that's a multiple of 32, like 128 or 256, but need to adjust based on N.

Wait, but for each row, the number of elements is N. So for each row, the number of threads needed is N. But if N is large, then the number of threads per block would be up to the block size. So maybe the block size should be set to a value that can handle the elements per row. However, since the kernel is written in Triton, which allows for dynamic thread counts, perhaps I can use a block size that's a multiple of 32, and then for each row, the threads process the elements in that row.

But how to handle the rows. Let me think: the kernel will process each row independently. So for each row, we need to find the minimum of the N elements in that row. So the kernel should iterate over each row, and for each row, process all elements in that row.

So the kernel should have a loop over the rows (M), and for each row, a loop over the elements (N). But in Triton, the kernel is written with a grid and blocks. So perhaps the kernel is launched with a grid of M blocks, each block handling one row. Then, each block processes the elements in that row.

But how to structure this. Let's think about the kernel parameters. The input tensor is a 2D tensor, so in Triton, the kernel will take the input tensor, the output tensor, and the dimensions M and N. The kernel will process each row (i.e., each row is handled by a block). So for each row, the block will process all N elements in that row.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a grid of blocks, and each block has a certain number of threads. So for each row, the block will have a certain number of threads. Let's say the block size is 128. Then, for each row, the threads will process the elements in that row. However, if N is less than the block size, then the threads will process the elements, but the extra threads would be masked out.

But how to handle the threads per block. Let's think: for each row, the number of elements is N. So for each row, the threads in the block will process the elements in that row. So the block will have a certain number of threads, say, 128, and each thread will process a single element in the row. But if N is smaller than 128, then the threads beyond N will be masked out.

So the kernel will have a loop over the rows (M), and for each row, a loop over the elements (N). But in Triton, the kernel is written with a grid of blocks, each block processing a row. Each block has a certain number of threads, and each thread processes a single element in the row.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written with a grid of blocks, and each block has a certain number of threads. So for example, if we have M rows, then the grid is M blocks. Each block has, say, 128 threads. Each thread will process a single element in the row. But for a row with N elements, the threads in the block will process the elements from 0 to N-1.

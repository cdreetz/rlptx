Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum over the columns (since the last dimension is N). So for each row in the tensor, I need to sum all the elements in that row. Wait, no. Wait, the tensor is [M, N], so the last dimension is N. So the reduction is along the N dimension. So for each row (M), sum all elements in that row. So the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding row.

Now, the input and output tensor shapes. The input is [M, N], and the output is [M]. The memory layout is probably row-major, so each row is contiguous in memory. So for a given row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j for j from 0 to N-1.

Next, optimal block sizes and memory access patterns. Triton kernels typically use a block size that's a power of two. Let's think about how to process each row. Each thread can handle a single row. But if the rows are processed in parallel, maybe each threadblock handles one row. Wait, but if the rows are processed in parallel, then each threadblock can handle one row. But for a 2D tensor, the rows are contiguous. So maybe each threadblock processes a single row, and each thread within the block processes a single element in that row. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each threadblock processes a range of elements in the row. Wait, but the reduction is along the entire row. So for each row, we need to sum all N elements. So for each row, we can have multiple threads working on that row, adding up the elements.

But how to structure this. Let me think. The kernel will process each row. So for each row i, we need to sum all elements in that row. So for each row, the threads can be divided into groups that process different elements. But since the reduction is across the entire row, perhaps each threadblock handles one row. So for each row, the threads in the block can compute the sum.

But how to handle the threads. Let's say we have a block size of, say, 128. For each row, the threads in the block can process elements in that row. But since the row has N elements, the number of threads per row would be N. But if N is large, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can use a block size that's larger than the number of elements per row. Wait, but that's not possible if the row is longer than the block size. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe each threadblock is responsible for a single row, and each thread in the block processes a single element in that row. Then, the threads in the block can perform a reduction across the elements of the row. But that would require that the number of threads per block is equal to the number of elements in the row. But that's not feasible if the row has more elements than the block size. So perhaps we need to use a different approach.

Wait, maybe the kernel should process each row, and for each row, the threads in the block are responsible for adding up the elements. For example, if the block size is 128, then each threadblock can handle a row, and each thread in the block can take a chunk of elements in that row. But how to split the elements. Let's think about the row as a 1D array. The number of elements per row is N. So for each row, the threads in the block can be divided into groups that add up parts of the row.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each threadblock processes a single row, and each thread in the block is responsible for adding a single element. Then, the threads in the block perform a reduction to sum all the elements. But that would require that the number of threads per block is equal to the number of elements in the row. However, if N is large, this would not be efficient. So maybe the block size is set to a value that can handle the elements in the row, but that's not possible for all N. So perhaps the kernel is designed to process each row, and for each row, the threads in the block are responsible for adding up the elements. But how to handle varying N.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed to process each row, and each threadblock is responsible for a single row. Then, the threads in the block are responsible for adding up the elements in that row. But how to do that. Let me think of the steps.

First, the kernel will iterate over each row. For each row, the threads in the

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations required. The task is to sum over the columns (since the last dimension is N). So for each row in the tensor, I need to add up all the elements in that row. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the tensor is [M, N], so the last dimension is N. So the reduction is along the N dimension. So for each row (M rows), sum all elements in that row. So the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding row.

So the kernel needs to process each row, and for each row, sum all the elements in that row. Now, how to structure this in Triton.

Next, input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output is a 1D tensor of shape [M]. The memory layout is probably row-major, so each row is contiguous in memory. So for a given row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j for j from 0 to N-1.

Now, for the Triton kernel, I need to decide on block sizes and memory access patterns. Since each row is processed independently, each block can handle one row. But how to structure the blocks? Let's think about the number of blocks. The number of rows is M, so each block can handle one row. But in Triton, blocks are usually processed in a way that each thread handles a part of the data. Alternatively, maybe each block processes a row, and each thread in the block handles a column in that row.

Wait, but for summing a row, each thread can handle a single element, and then accumulate. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each block can process multiple elements in the row, using shared memory or warp-level operations.

But for a sum reduction, a common approach is to have each thread handle a single element, and then perform a reduction within the warp. But since the row is contiguous, maybe each block can process a row, and each thread in the block handles a portion of the row.

Alternatively, considering that each row is of length N, and the number of threads per block can be set to a value that allows for efficient processing. Let's say we have a block size of, say, 128 threads. Then, each block can process a row, and each thread handles a portion of the row. But how to split the row into chunks.

But maybe a better approach is to have each thread handle a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction across the threads in the block. However, for that, the number of threads per block should be a power of two, so that the reduction can be done efficiently.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, if each thread in the block handles one element, then the number of threads per block should be equal to the number of elements in the row. But that's not feasible if N is large. So perhaps the block size is chosen such that each block can process a row, and the threads in the block work together to sum the elements.

Alternatively, since the row is of length N, and the block size is set to a value that allows for efficient processing. For example, if N is large, then each block can process a row, and each thread in the block handles a portion of the row. But how to split that.

Alternatively, maybe each block is responsible for a single row. Then, for each row, the threads in the block can compute the sum. Let's think about this.

Let me think about the parameters. The kernel will take the input tensor, and output tensor. The input is [M, N], output is [M].

Each thread in the block will process a single element in the row. But since the row is of length N, the number of threads per block should be at least N. But that's not feasible if N is large. So maybe the block size is set to a value that allows for efficient processing, and the threads in the block can compute the sum using a reduction.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, if each thread in the block handles a single element, then the number of threads per block is N. However, that's not possible if N is larger than the block size. So perhaps the block size is set to a value that allows for efficient reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the block size is set to a value that allows for multiple threads per block to process elements in the row, and then perform a reduction. For example, if the block size is 128, then for a row of N elements, each thread in the block can handle a chunk of elements, and then

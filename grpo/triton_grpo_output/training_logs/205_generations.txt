Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works. The result should be a tensor of shape [M, N], where each element is the sum of the products of elements from the first matrix's row and the second matrix's column.

First, I need to figure out the GPU operations required. Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for parallelism, so I should structure the kernel to handle each element of the resulting matrix. The key is to use shared memory for the input matrices to reduce global memory access latency.

The input tensors are A (M, K) and B (K, N). The output is C (M, N). Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. 

In Triton, I'll need to loop over the rows of A and columns of B. For each row i in A and column j in B, I need to compute the dot product of the i-th row of A and the j-th column of B. 

Now, considering the memory layout. The input tensors are stored in row-major order. For A, each row is contiguous in memory. For B, each column is contiguous. But in Triton, we can use shared memory to load chunks of A and B. 

The block size is important. A common choice is 32 or 64 elements per block. Let's pick 32. Each thread will handle a block of K elements. Wait, but K could be large. So, the number of blocks in the K dimension would be ceil(K / BLOCK_SIZE). 

But for matrix multiplication, each threadblock should process a block of rows from A and columns from B. Wait, maybe I should structure the kernel such that each threadblock handles a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. Alternatively, each threadblock can handle a block of K elements, and each thread within the block handles a particular k. 

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton. Each threadblock processes a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. For example, if the block size is 32, each threadblock can handle a block of K elements (for A's rows) and a block of N elements (for B's columns). But that might not be efficient if K or N is large. 

Alternatively, each threadblock can handle a block of K elements, and each thread within the block handles a particular k. Wait, but that's not quite right. Let me think again. 

In the standard matrix multiplication, each threadblock processes a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. For example, if the block size is 32, each threadblock handles a block of size 32x32. But that's for when the matrices are square. However, in our case, the matrices are rectangular. 

Alternatively, for each thread, we can compute a single element of C. But that's not efficient. So, perhaps the kernel should be structured so that each threadblock handles a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. 

Wait, maybe I should use the approach where each threadblock computes a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. For example, if the block size is 32, each threadblock handles a block of 32 rows from A and 32 columns from B. But that would require that the number of rows in A is a multiple of 32, and the same for columns in B. But since the problem is general, we need to handle cases where the dimensions are not multiples of the block size. 

Alternatively, each threadblock handles a block of K elements, and each thread in the block handles a particular k. But that's not quite right. Let me think of the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton. 

In the standard approach, the kernel is structured as follows: each threadblock handles a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. For each thread in the block, it computes a single element of C. However, this is not efficient because each thread would need to access K elements from A and B. 

Alternatively, using shared memory, each threadblock can load a block of rows from A into shared memory, and a block of columns from B into shared memory. Then, each thread in the block can compute the dot product of its row in A and column in B. 

Wait, but for matrix multiplication, the standard approach is to have each threadblock process a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. For example, if the block size is 32, then each threadblock handles a block of 32 rows from A and

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by understanding what this entails.

First, the problem is to compute the product of two matrices: A (MxK) and B (KxN), resulting in a matrix C (MxN). Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. 

So, the kernel needs to handle this computation efficiently on the GPU using Triton. Let me think about the steps involved.

The main operations here are element-wise multiplications and summations. Since Triton is a high-performance library, I need to make sure that the kernel is optimized for memory access and parallelism.

Let me consider the input tensors. The first tensor A has shape [M, K], and the second tensor B has shape [K, N]. The output tensor C will have shape [M, N]. 

In Triton, each kernel launch is divided into blocks, and each block processes a certain number of elements. The key is to choose the right block size and memory layout to maximize throughput.

For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to handle a portion of the computation. Typically, for matrix multiplication, the block size is chosen such that each thread block can process a submatrix of the input matrices. However, since we're dealing with two matrices, the block size might be determined by the number of elements each thread can handle in the inner loop.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order (assuming that's the default in Triton). So, for A, each row is contiguous in memory. Similarly for B. The output tensor C will also be stored in row-major order.

Now, for the kernel, each thread will compute a single element of C. But that's not efficient because it would lead to a lot of memory accesses. Instead, we can use a more efficient approach where each thread block computes a block of elements in C. However, since the problem is general, maybe we can use a more standard approach where each thread computes a single element, but with proper memory access patterns.

Wait, but for matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to handle a certain number of elements in the inner loop. For example, using a block size of 32, and each thread handles a certain number of elements in the K dimension. However, since the problem is to multiply two matrices, the inner loop is over K, which is the dimension that's being summed over.

So, the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element of C, but with a loop over K. However, this would lead to a lot of memory accesses. To optimize, we can use shared memory to store slices of A and B, so that each thread can access the required elements more efficiently.

But in this case, since the problem is to write a Triton kernel, perhaps the approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to process a certain number of elements in the K dimension. Let me think about the parameters.

Let me consider the kernel parameters. The kernel will take the input tensors A, B, and the output tensor C. The kernel needs to process each element of C. The main challenge is to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

So, the kernel will have indices i (row in A and C), j (column in B and C), and k (the dimension being summed over). Each thread will compute one element of C[i][j], which requires accessing A[i][k] and B[k][j] for all k, then summing them.

But if we do this naively, each thread would have to perform K memory accesses, which could be slow. To optimize, we can use shared memory to store a slice of A and B, so that each thread can access the required elements from shared memory, which is faster.

However, in Triton, the kernel is written in a way that each thread is responsible for a certain part of the computation. Let me think about how to structure the kernel.

First, the kernel needs to be able to process the entire matrix. So, the kernel will have parameters for the dimensions M, K, N, and the strides of the tensors. But in Triton, the kernel is typically written with the assumption that the input tensors are stored in a way that allows for efficient access.

Alternatively, the kernel can be written with the assumption that the input tensors are stored in row-major order, and each thread is responsible for a specific (i, j) pair in C.

But given that the problem is to multiply two matrices, the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element of C, and the inner loop is over k. However, this

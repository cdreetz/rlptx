Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in the context of GPU kernels, especially with Triton.

First, the problem is to compute C = A * B, where A is MxK and B is KxN. The result C will be MxN. The standard approach for matrix multiplication on GPUs is to use shared memory to store tiles of the matrices, which helps reduce memory bandwidth usage and improves performance.

So, the steps I need to take are:

1. **Understand the GPU operations**: The kernel needs to perform element-wise multiplications and summations. Each element in the resulting matrix C is the sum of the products of elements from the corresponding row of A and column of B.

2. **Tensor shapes and memory layout**: The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. For matrix multiplication, each thread will handle a specific element in the result matrix. However, with tile-based computation, threads will work on smaller blocks (tiles) of the matrices.

3. **Optimal block sizes and memory access patterns**: I need to choose a block size that allows for efficient use of shared memory. Typically, a block size of 32 or 64 is used. The tiles should be of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), which allows for efficient computation. The shared memory will store tiles of A and B.

4. **Edge cases with masking**: If the tiles don't fit into the matrix dimensions, we need to handle cases where the tile is cut off. This can be done by using masks to ignore out-of-bounds accesses.

Now, let's think about the structure of the kernel. The kernel will process each element of the output matrix C. Each thread will be responsible for a specific element (i, j) in C. However, with tile-based computation, the threads will work on tiles of A and B.

First, I need to determine the tile size. Let's say the tile size is TILE_M x TILE_N, but since the matrices are A (MxK) and B (KxN), the tiles for A and B should be of size TILE_K x TILE_K, perhaps? Wait, no. Let me think again.

In matrix multiplication, each thread block typically handles a tile of A and a tile of B. For example, if the tile size is (TILE_K, TILE_K), then each thread block will compute a portion of the result matrix. However, the exact tile size depends on the problem. Alternatively, the tile size could be (TILE_M, TILE_N) for the output matrix, but that might not be efficient.

Alternatively, the standard approach is to use a block size that allows for efficient computation of the inner product. For example, each thread computes a part of the inner product. But with shared memory, the tiles are stored in shared memory, and each thread computes a part of the sum.

Let me recall the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton. The kernel typically has a loop over the rows of A and columns of B. Each thread computes a part of the inner product. However, with shared memory, the tiles are stored in shared memory, and each thread computes a part of the sum.

But for the problem here, the user specified tile-based computation with shared memory. So, the kernel should process tiles of A and B, and compute the product.

Let me outline the steps:

- The kernel will process each element (i, j) in the output matrix C. Each thread will compute a specific element of C by multiplying the corresponding elements of A's row i and B's column j, then summing them up.

But with tile-based computation, the threads will work on tiles of A and B. So, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread block handles a tile of A and a tile of B, and computes a portion of the result matrix.

But how to structure this in Triton?

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured with each thread handling a specific element (i, j) in the result matrix, but using shared memory to store tiles of A and B. However, this approach might not be as efficient as tile-based computation.

Wait, the user is asking for tile-based computation with shared memory, so I need to implement that.

Let me think about the standard approach for matrix multiplication with shared memory. The idea is to divide the matrices into tiles, store them in shared memory, and compute the product using these tiles.

For example, if the tile size is (TILE_M, TILE_K) for matrix A and (TILE_K, TILE_N) for matrix B, then each thread block can compute a portion of the result matrix.

But the exact tile size depends on the problem. Let me choose a block size of 32, which is a common choice

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through the steps.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first matrix is M x K, the second is K x N. The result should be M x N. So each element in the output is the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix.

Triton kernels work with threads, and I need to structure them in a way that uses shared memory for efficiency. Shared memory is faster than global memory, so tiling the matrices into blocks will help. The key is to load chunks of the matrices into shared memory, compute the dot product, and then store the result.

Let me recall the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton. Typically, each thread block handles a block of the output matrix. For each element in the output, the thread block computes it by multiplying corresponding elements from the two input matrices and summing them up.

But since we're using shared memory, I need to split the matrices into tiles. Let's say each tile is of size BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K for the first matrix and BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N for the second. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of how the threads are organized. Each thread block will handle a block of the output matrix. The threads within the block will compute the elements of that block.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element of the output matrix. But with shared memory, we can load rows of the first matrix and columns of the second matrix into shared memory, then compute the dot product. However, for large K, this might not be efficient. So tile-based computation is needed.

Let me think about the tile size. Let's say each thread block handles a tile of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K) for the first matrix and (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N) for the second. But maybe I should split the matrices into tiles of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K) for the first matrix and (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N) for the second. Then, each thread block computes a tile of the output matrix.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread block compute a block of the output matrix. For example, if the output is M x N, then each block of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N) is computed by a thread block. Each thread in the block computes a single element of the output. But to do that efficiently, the threads need to load rows of the first matrix and columns of the second matrix into shared memory.

Alternatively, for each element in the output, the thread computes the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix. But for that, the rows of the first matrix and columns of the second matrix need to be loaded into shared memory. However, if K is large, this could be memory-intensive. So, tiling is needed to reduce the amount of data that needs to be loaded into shared memory.

So, the idea is to split the matrices into tiles. For example, the first matrix (M x K) is split into tiles of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K), and the second matrix (K x N) is split into tiles of size (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N). Then, each thread block computes a tile of the output matrix by multiplying the corresponding tiles of the input matrices.

But how to structure the threads? Each thread block would handle a block of the output matrix. For each element in the output block, the thread would compute the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix. But to do that, the threads need to load the corresponding rows and columns into shared memory.

Alternatively, each thread block computes a block of the output matrix. For each element in the output block, the thread would compute the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix. However, this would require that the rows of the first matrix and columns of the second matrix are loaded into shared memory.

But for this, the shared memory would need to be large enough to hold the tiles. Let's say the first matrix is split into tiles of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K), and the second into (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N). Then, each thread block would handle a tile of the output matrix.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to use a block size of (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K) for the first matrix and (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N) for the second. Then, each thread block computes a tile of the output matrix. Each thread in the block computes a single element of the output.

But I need to think about the memory layout. The first matrix is of shape [M, K], and the second is [K, N]. So, for the first matrix, each row is of

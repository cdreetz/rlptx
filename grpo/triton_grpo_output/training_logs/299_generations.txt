Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that adds two 1D tensors element-wise. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the GPU operations. The kernel needs to take two input tensors and produce an output tensor where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements from the inputs. So, for each element in the input tensors, I add them together and store the result in the output.

Next, the input and output shapes. The problem says they're 1D tensors of size N. So each input has shape (N,) and the output will also be (N,). The memory layout is probably contiguous in memory, so each tensor is stored as a flat array in memory. The kernel needs to access each element in order.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels use warps and threads per warp. A common approach is to use a block size that's a multiple of the warp size (32). Let's say BLOCK_SIZE = 256. But since each thread processes one element, maybe a smaller block size like 128 or 256. Wait, for element-wise operations, each thread can handle one element. So the block size can be set to 256, and each thread processes one element. But if N is not a multiple of the block size, we need to handle that.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is launched with a number of blocks that's determined by the number of elements. For example, if N is 1024, then we can have 4 blocks of 256 threads each. Each thread computes one element. So the kernel should process each element in sequence.

So the plan is: each thread computes the sum of the i-th element from the two input tensors and stores it in the output tensor. The threads are arranged in a way that each thread handles one element.

Now, the memory access. The input tensors are passed as pointers. Each thread needs to calculate the index i = thread_idx. Then, load the value from input1[i], input2[i], add them, and store into output[i].

But how to handle the indices? The kernel is launched with a number of blocks, and each thread has a thread index. So in the kernel, each thread will compute its own index as i = thread_idx. Then, the kernel needs to access the input tensors at i, and the output at i.

But wait, in Triton, the kernel is launched with a number of blocks, and each block has a number of threads. For example, if we have N elements, the number of blocks is ceil(N / BLOCK_SIZE). Each thread in the block has a thread index (0 to BLOCK_SIZE-1). So the total number of threads is the number of blocks multiplied by the block size. But if N is not a multiple of the block size, the last block will have fewer threads.

So for each thread, the index is determined by the thread's position in the block. So in the kernel, the thread index is computed as the thread's position within the block. Then, the global index is thread_idx + block_idx * BLOCK_SIZE. Wait, no. Actually, in Triton, the thread index is computed as the thread's position within the block. So the global index is block_idx * BLOCK_SIZE + thread_idx. But if the block is not the last one, then the thread_idx is within the block. But for the kernel, the total number of elements is N, so we need to make sure that the thread doesn't access beyond N-1.

So, in the kernel, for each thread, compute the index i = block_idx * BLOCK_SIZE + thread_idx. But then, we need to check if i is less than N. If not, we skip. But how to handle that? Well, in Triton, the kernel is launched with a number of blocks, and each thread is responsible for a specific index. So the kernel should compute the index i = block_idx * BLOCK_SIZE + thread_idx, but then check if i < N. If not, do nothing. But how to do that in the code?

Alternatively, the kernel can be launched with a number of blocks that's ceil(N / BLOCK_SIZE), and each thread computes its own index. So the code would be:

def kernel:
    pid = tl.program_id(0)
    i = pid
    if i >= N:
        return
    a = tl.load(input1 + i)
    b = tl.load(input2 + i)
    c = a + b
    tl.store(output + i, c)

But wait, how is the input and output passed? The kernel needs to have the input and output tensors as parameters. So in the @triton.jit decorator, the kernel function would take the input1, input2, output, and N as parameters.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with the parameters as arguments.

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that adds two 1D tensors element-wise. Let me start by thinking about what operations are required.

First, the GPU operations. Since it's element-wise addition, each element in the first tensor is added to the corresponding element in the second tensor. So, for each element in the input tensors, I'll compute the sum and store it in the output tensor.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The problem states that both input tensors are 1D of size N. So, each input has shape (N,) and the output will also be (N,). The memory layout is probably contiguous in the tensors, so I can access them in a linear fashion.

Now, block sizes and memory access patterns. Triton kernels use threads per block, and I need to choose a block size that's efficient. Typically, for 1D operations, a block size of 256 is common, but maybe 128 or 512 could work. Let me think: if N is large, using a block size that's a power of two might be better for cache efficiency. Let's pick 256 as the block size. Each thread will handle a certain number of elements, but since it's 1D, maybe each thread handles one element? Wait, no. If the block size is 256, then each thread can process one element, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each thread processes a chunk of elements, but for a simple add, perhaps each thread handles one element. Wait, but for a 1D tensor, if the block size is 256, then each thread would process one element, and there would be 256 threads per block. But if N is not a multiple of 256, then some threads might be idle. But that's okay, as Triton handles that.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. So, each thread would process one element. Let me think: the kernel would iterate over each element in the input tensors, and for each index i, compute output[i] = input1[i] + input2[i]. So, the kernel would have a loop that runs for N elements, and each thread handles one element. But how to structure that.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is written with a loop over the elements, and each thread is responsible for a single element. So, the kernel would have a loop that runs for N elements, and each thread computes one element. But how to map the thread index to the element index. Let me think: the thread index can be determined by the thread ID. For example, in a block of 256 threads, each thread has an ID from 0 to 255. Then, the element index is thread_id. But if N is less than the number of threads in the block, then some threads would be out of bounds. So, we need to handle that with masking.

So, the steps would be:

1. For each thread in the block, compute the index i = thread_id.
2. Check if i is within the range [0, N-1]. If not, skip (mask).
3. Load input1[i] and input2[i] from memory.
4. Add them and store the result in output[i].

Now, the memory access. The tensors are 1D, so each element is accessed by its index. So, for input1, the address is computed as input1_ptr + i * elem_size. Similarly for input2 and output.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. So, the kernel would have a loop that runs for N elements, and each thread handles one element. Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop that is controlled by the number of elements. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured with a loop that runs for the number of elements, and each thread handles one element. But how to structure that. Let me think: the kernel would have a loop that runs for the number of elements, and each thread is responsible for one element. However, in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop that is controlled by the number of elements, and each thread is responsible for a single element. So, the code would look something like:

@triton.jit
def kernel(input1, input2, output, N, ...):
    pid = tl.program_id(0)
    i = pid
    if i >= N:
        return
    # load input1[i], input2[i]
    # compute sum
    # store to output[i]

But then, the loop is not explicit. Instead, the kernel is written with a loop that is controlled by the number of elements. Wait, maybe the kernel is written with a loop that runs for the number

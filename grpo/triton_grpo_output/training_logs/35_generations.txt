Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is to compute the mean along the last dimension. So for each row (since the last dimension is N), we need to sum all elements and then divide by N. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

Let me recall how Triton kernels work. Triton is a high-performance GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA, but with more abstractions. The kernel will process elements in blocks, with each thread handling a portion of the data.

So, the steps I need to take:

1. Determine the GPU operations: For each row in the input tensor, sum all elements in that row, then divide by N. So, for each row, sum the N elements and then divide by N.

2. Input and output tensor shapes: Input is [M, N], output is [M]. So, each row in the input corresponds to one element in the output.

3. Block sizes and memory access: Since we're processing rows, each block can handle multiple rows. But since each row has N elements, the block size needs to be chosen such that each thread can process a single element in a row. Wait, but if we're processing rows, maybe each thread can handle one element in a row. But since each row has N elements, perhaps each block can handle a row, and each thread in the block processes one element in that row. Alternatively, maybe the block size is set to process multiple elements per thread, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, since each row has N elements, and each thread can process one element, then for each row, we have N threads. But that might be inefficient if N is large. However, since we need to sum all elements in a row, perhaps each thread can process one element, and then the sum is computed across the threads in the block.

Wait, but how to handle the sum. Let me think: For each row, each thread in the block handles one element. Then, the threads in the block can sum their elements and then compute the average. But the block needs to process all N elements of a row. So, the block size should be such that each block processes one row. But how to split the rows across blocks?

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured so that each block processes a single row. Then, each block has N elements to process. But how to divide the rows among the blocks. For example, if there are M rows, then each block can handle one row. So, the number of blocks would be M. But that might not be efficient if M is large, but since Triton can handle that, perhaps it's manageable.

But perhaps a better approach is to have each thread process one element in a row. Then, each row is processed by multiple threads. But how to organize that.

Alternatively, for each row, we can have a group of threads that compute the sum. Let's think in terms of threads per block. Suppose each block has a certain number of threads, say, 128. Then, for each row, the threads in the block can process the elements of that row. But how to map the threads to the elements.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensor is [M, N], so each row is of length N. The output is [M], so each output element is the mean of the corresponding row.

So, for each row i (from 0 to M-1), we need to sum the elements from column 0 to N-1 of row i, then divide by N.

So, the kernel needs to process each row, sum its elements, and then compute the average.

Now, how to structure the kernel. Let's consider that each thread in the block handles one element of a row. But since each row has N elements, and each thread can handle one element, then for each row, there are N threads. But if the block size is 128, then each block can process up to 128 elements. However, since each row has N elements, the number of blocks needed would be ceil(M * N / 128). But that might be inefficient.

Alternatively, perhaps each block processes a single row. So, the number of blocks is M. Each block has N elements to process. But how to structure that.

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in a row. So, for each row i, the threads in the block process elements from column j to j + (block size - 1). But that might not be the case. Maybe the kernel is structured such that

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is to calculate the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. Since the tensor is [M, N], each row has N elements, and we need to compute the average for each row. So for each row i, sum all elements in column 0 to N-1 and divide by N.

Now, considering Triton kernels, I need to structure the kernel to process rows in parallel. Each thread will handle one row. So the kernel should iterate over each row, sum the elements in that row, then divide by N.

Let me think about the input and output. The input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

For the kernel, I'll need to process each row. Let's assume that the input tensor is stored in row-major order, which is the default for most GPU tensors. So each row is contiguous in memory.

The steps for each thread:
1. Get the row index (i) and the column index (j) for the elements in the row.
2. Sum all elements in the row.
3. Divide the sum by N to get the mean.

But how to structure the threads? Since each row is processed independently, each thread can handle one row. So the number of threads per block should be such that each thread processes one row. However, Triton's default is to have each thread process one element, but here we need to process N elements per row. Wait, no. Wait, each thread will process one row. So the number of threads per block should be equal to the number of rows, M. But that might not be efficient if M is large. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread process a single element, but that would require more threads. Hmm, perhaps I need to think in terms of blocks and threads.

Wait, perhaps I should structure the kernel such that each thread handles one row. So, for each row i, the thread will sum all elements in that row. But how to do that efficiently.

Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread handle a single element in the row, but that would require more threads. But for a 2D tensor, if each thread is responsible for a single element, then for each row, there are N elements. But since the kernel is designed to process rows, maybe it's better to have each thread handle one row.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows. Let me think: the kernel will have a loop over the rows, and for each row, sum all the elements in that row.

So the kernel will have a loop over i (rows), and for each i, loop over j (columns) and accumulate the sum.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let me think about the parameters. The input tensor is a 2D tensor, so in Triton, we can pass it as a pointer, and then access it with i and j.

But for the kernel, the number of threads per block would be determined by the number of rows. However, if M is large, then the number of threads per block might be limited. So perhaps the kernel is written with a loop over the rows, and each thread processes one row.

But how to handle that. Let me think of the kernel's code structure.

The kernel would be written as:

@triton.jit
def kernel(...):
    # get the row index
    i = ... 
    # compute the sum for this row
    sum_val = 0
    for j in range(N):
        sum_val += input[i, j]
    # compute mean
    mean_val = sum_val / N
    # store the result in output[i]

But how to handle the loop over j. Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. However, for each row, the columns are N elements. So the kernel would have to loop over the rows, and for each row, loop over the columns.

But the problem is that for each row, the number of columns is N, which is fixed. So the kernel would have to have a loop over the rows, and for each row, loop over the columns.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. However, in this case, each row has N elements, so for each row, we need to process N elements. So the kernel would have to have a loop over the rows, and for each row, a loop over the columns.

But how to structure that in Triton. Let's think about the parameters. The input is a 2D tensor, and

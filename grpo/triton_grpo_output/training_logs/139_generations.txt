Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, the input is a 2D tensor with dimensions M (rows) and N (columns). The goal is to sum along the last dimension, which means for each row, I need to sum all the elements in that row. So the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding row.

Now, thinking about how to implement this in Triton. Triton kernels are written in a way that's similar to CUDA, but with some differences. The key is to process the tensor in blocks, using shared memory if needed, and handle memory accesses efficiently.

Let me outline the steps:

1. **GPU Operations**: For each row in the 2D tensor, sum all elements in that row. So each thread should handle a single element in the row, but since we need to sum, maybe multiple threads can work on the same row, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, each thread could handle a single element, and then accumulate the sum. Wait, but if each thread is responsible for a single element, then for each row, all threads in the block would process that row's elements. But how to organize that.

Wait, perhaps the block size should be such that each block processes one row. For example, if each block processes one row, then each thread in the block would process a column in that row. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each thread processes a single element, and then the block reduces the sum of the elements in the row.

But for a 2D tensor, the rows are along the first dimension. So for a given row i, the elements are at positions (i, 0), (i, 1), ..., (i, N-1). So the sum for row i is the sum of all elements in that row.

So, the kernel needs to iterate over each row, and for each row, sum all elements in that row.

But how to structure the threads. Let's think about the block size. Let's say each block processes one row. Then, for each row, the threads in the block would process the elements in that row. But how to split the elements across threads.

Alternatively, each thread could handle a single element in the row. Then, for each row, the threads in the block would compute the sum of that row. But how to manage that.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensor is [M, N], so each row has N elements. So for a given row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j, where j ranges from 0 to N-1. But in Triton, the tensor is accessed as a 1D array, so maybe the kernel is given the tensor as a 1D array, and the row and column indices are computed.

Wait, in Triton, the kernel is written with the tensor as a 1D array, and the indices are computed based on the row and column. So for a 2D tensor, the index in the 1D array is i * N + j, where i is the row index and j is the column index.

So the kernel needs to process each row. Let's think about how to structure the threads. For each row i, the threads in the block would process the elements in that row. So the block size should be such that each block processes one row. But if the number of rows M is not divisible by the block count, then we need to handle that. However, in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows, and each block processes one row.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is written with a loop over the rows, and each thread in the block processes a column in that row. But that would require that each block processes one row, and the threads in the block process the columns of that row.

So, for each row i, the threads in the block would process the columns j from 0 to N-1. But how to split the columns among the threads. Let's say the block size is BLOCK_SIZE, and each thread in the block handles a column j. Then, the number of threads per block would be N, but that's not efficient if N is large. So perhaps the block size is set to a value that allows for efficient processing.

Wait, but for a row with N elements, if the block size is larger than N, then the threads in the block would process the elements of the row. But if the block size is smaller, then multiple blocks would be needed for a single row. However, since each row is processed by a block, perhaps the block size is set to the number of elements in the row, but that's not feasible for large N.

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum each column of the tensor. So for each column (which is the last dimension), we need to add up all the elements in that column. The input is a 2D tensor with M rows and N columns. The output should be a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the sum of the corresponding column.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The input is [M, N], and the output is [M]. The memory layout is probably row-major, so each row is stored contiguously. For a 2D tensor, the elements are stored as [0, 0], [0, 1], ..., [0, N-1], [1, 0], etc. So for a column j, the elements are at positions (i, j) for i from 0 to M-1. So the index for element (i, j) is i * N + j. Wait, no. Wait, if it's a 2D tensor, the memory layout is such that each row is contiguous. So for a tensor of shape [M, N], the element at row i, column j is stored at position i * N + j. So to access column j, we need to iterate over all rows i, and for each i, the index is i * N + j.

But in Triton, when you have a 2D tensor, you can access it as a 2D array. However, in Triton, the kernel is written in terms of indices. So perhaps the kernel will take the input tensor as a 1D array, and the kernel will compute the sum for each column.

But how to handle the indices. Let me think. For each column j in 0..N-1, we need to sum all elements in that column. So for each column j, the elements are at positions (i, j) for i from 0 to M-1. So in terms of the 1D array, the index for (i, j) is i * N + j. So for a given j, the elements are at i * N + j for i in 0..M-1.

But in the kernel, we need to process each column. So the kernel needs to iterate over each column, and for each column, iterate over all the rows, adding the elements.

But how to structure the kernel. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The input tensor is a 1D array of shape [M*N], and the output is a 1D array of shape [N]. Wait, no. Wait, the output is [M], because each column is summed. Wait, no. Wait, the original tensor is [M, N], so each column is of length M. So the sum of each column is a 1D array of size N. Wait, no, the problem says sum along the last dimension. The last dimension is N. So the sum is over N elements, resulting in a tensor of shape [M], since each row is summed. Wait, no. Wait, the tensor is [M, N], and the sum is along the last dimension (N), so the result is [M]. Because for each row, you sum across the columns. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the sum along the last dimension would be for each row, sum across the columns. So the output is [M], each element is the sum of the row. Wait, but the problem says "sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]". So the last dimension is N, so the sum is over N elements, resulting in a tensor of shape [M]. So for each row, sum all elements in that row. Wait, but that's the sum along the last dimension. So the output is [M], each element is the sum of the row.

Wait, but the user says "sum reduction along the last dimension". So for a 2D tensor, the last dimension is the second dimension. So sum over the second dimension. So for example, if the tensor is [M, N], then the sum over the last dimension (N) would be a tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the elements in that row. So the kernel needs to compute for each row, the sum of its elements.

Wait, but that's not what the user wrote. Wait, the user says "sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]". So the last dimension is N. So the sum is over N elements. So for each row, sum all elements in that row.

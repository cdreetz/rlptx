Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations required. Since it's a min reduction along the last dimension, each row (since the last dimension is N) needs to find the minimum value. So for each row in the tensor, we need to find the minimum value across all elements in that row.

Next, input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Now, block sizes and memory access patterns. Triton kernels typically use a grid of blocks, each processing a portion of the data. For this problem, each block can handle a single row. But since there are M rows, each block can process one row. However, if M is large, maybe we can have multiple blocks process different rows. Wait, but for each row, we need to process N elements. So maybe each block processes a single row, and the number of blocks is M. But that might not be efficient if M is large. Alternatively, maybe we can have each block process multiple rows, but that might complicate the logic. Let me think.

Alternatively, since each row is independent, we can have each block handle one row. So the number of blocks would be M. But in Triton, the grid is determined by the number of rows. So for each row, we can have one block. But how to structure the kernel.

Wait, the kernel is written with a grid of blocks. So the grid size would be determined by the number of rows. For example, if there are M rows, then the grid has M blocks. Each block processes one row.

But how to structure the kernel. Let me think about the parameters. The kernel needs to take the input tensor, the output tensor, the shape (M, N), and maybe the stride information.

In Triton, the kernel is written with a @triton.jit decorator, and the kernel function is called with the input and output tensors, and the shape. The kernel needs to process each row.

So for each block, we can compute the row index. For example, the row index can be determined by the block's index. Then, for that row, we need to find the minimum value across all N elements.

But how to handle the memory access. The input tensor is 2D, so each element is accessed with row and column indices. For a given row, the elements are in consecutive memory locations. So for a row i, the elements are at positions i * N + j for j from 0 to N-1.

But in Triton, the memory layout is important. The input tensor is probably stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. So for a given row i, the elements are at i * N + j.

So, for each row, the kernel needs to iterate over all N elements, find the minimum.

But how to do that efficiently. Let's think about the steps:

1. For each block, compute the row index (i).
2. For that row, iterate over all columns (j) from 0 to N-1.
3. Load each element from the input tensor.
4. Track the minimum value for that row.
5. Store the minimum value in the output tensor at position i.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the grid and then a loop over the elements. So the kernel would be structured as:

@triton.jit
def kernel(input, output, M, N, ...):
    # Determine the row index for this block
    i = ... # block index
    # For this row, find the minimum
    min_val = ... # initialize to infinity
    for j in range(N):
        val = tl.load(input + i * N + j)
        if val < min_val:
            min_val = val
    tl.store(output + i, min_val)

But how to handle the grid and block indices. The grid is determined by the number of rows, M. So the kernel would be called with a grid of size (M,). Each block processes one row.

But in Triton, the kernel is called with a grid of blocks, and each block has a thread index. So the code would be something like:

def min_reduction_kernel(input, output, M, N):
    # ... kernel code ...
    grid = (M,)
    kernel = triton.jit(...)
    kernel(input, output, M, N, ...)

But how to compute the row index. For each block, the thread index is determined by the block's position. So for the grid, each block is assigned a row index. So in the kernel, the row

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. So, the input is a 2D tensor, and the output should be a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row in the input.

First, I need to think about the GPU operations required. Since we're dealing with a reduction along the last dimension, each row (each M element) needs to find the minimum of N elements. So, for each row, we need to iterate through all N elements and track the minimum.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The input is [M, N], and the output is [M]. The memory layout should be contiguous, so the input is stored in row-major order, which is the default for tensors. The output will be a 1D array where each element corresponds to the minimum of each row.

Now, considering the block sizes and memory access patterns. Triton kernels are divided into blocks, and each block processes a certain number of elements. For this problem, since each row has N elements, the block size should be chosen such that each block can process a row. However, since we're doing a reduction, maybe we can have each thread handle a single element in the row and then reduce across threads in the block.

Wait, but for a reduction, the standard approach is to have each thread handle a single element, then threads combine their results. But since each row is independent, maybe we can process each row in a block. However, if N is large, we need to make sure that the block can handle the reduction efficiently.

Alternatively, for each row, we can have multiple threads working on that row. Let's think: each thread in a block can handle a single element in the row. Then, the block reduces across all threads to find the minimum. But how to structure this.

Wait, the problem is that for each row, we need to find the minimum of N elements. So for each row, we can have a group of threads that process that row. But since each row is independent, maybe we can process each row in a separate block. However, that might not be efficient if the number of rows is large. Alternatively, we can have each block process a row, and each block's threads work on the elements of that row.

But how to structure the threads. Let's think about the grid and blocks. The grid will have M blocks, each corresponding to a row. Each block will process the elements of that row. But for each row, the number of elements is N. So, for each block, the threads will process the elements of that row.

But in Triton, the grid is defined by the number of blocks, and each block has a certain number of threads. So, for each row (M rows), we can have a block that processes that row. The number of threads per block would be determined by how many elements per row we can process. But since each element is processed by a thread, and then the block reduces across threads to find the minimum.

Wait, but for each row, the number of elements is N. So, the number of threads per block would be the number of elements in the row. But that might be too many threads for a block. Alternatively, we can have a block with a certain number of threads, say, BLOCK_SIZE, and each thread handles a chunk of elements in the row. But that might complicate the reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the block is responsible for processing a single row. Let's think: each block is assigned a row index. Then, within the block, the threads process the elements of that row. For example, if the block has BLOCK_SIZE threads, then each thread can process a single element in the row. Then, the block reduces across all threads to find the minimum of the row.

But how to handle the case where N is not a multiple of the block size. For example, if N is 10 and the block size is 8, then the last thread in the block would process the 10th element. But that's okay, as long as the threads are properly masked.

So, the steps would be:

1. For each row (i) in the input tensor, we need to find the minimum of the elements in that row.

2. Each block is assigned a row index i.

3. Within the block, each thread processes a single element in the row. The thread index within the block (thread_idx) corresponds to the position in the row.

4. The block then reduces across all threads to find the minimum of the row.

But how to handle the case where the row has fewer elements than the block size. For example, if N is 5 and the block size is 8, then the threads in the block would process elements 0-4, and the remaining

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by understanding what's required here.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first matrix is MxK, the second is KxN, so the result should be MxN. Each element in the resulting matrix is the sum of the product of elements from the first row and the corresponding column in the second matrix.

Now, thinking about how to implement this in Triton. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA, but with more abstraction. The key is to structure the kernel to efficiently use the GPU's resources, like memory access patterns and thread blocking.

Let me break down the steps:

1. **GPU Operations**: The main operation is matrix multiplication. Each thread will compute one element of the result matrix. But since matrix multiplication is computationally intensive, we need to optimize for memory access and parallelism.

2. **Input/Output Shapes**: The inputs are A (M, K) and B (K, N). The output is C (M, N). So, each thread will compute C[i][j] = sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

3. **Block Sizes and Memory Access**: For efficient memory access, we need to use shared memory to store slices of the input matrices. The threads should be organized into blocks where each block handles a portion of the matrix. The block size should be chosen to maximize occupancy and efficient memory access. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 threads is common, but I need to check if that's optimal here.

Wait, but in Triton, the block size is determined by the kernel's configuration. Let me think about the layout. Each thread in the block will handle a specific element in the result matrix. But since K can be large, we need to make sure that each thread can access the necessary elements from A and B efficiently.

Wait, maybe I should structure the kernel such that each thread computes a single element of the result. But for that, each thread would need to iterate over K elements, multiplying corresponding elements from A and B and summing them. However, this approach would have a lot of memory accesses, which could be slow if not optimized.

Alternatively, we can use a more optimized approach where each thread block handles a block of rows and columns. But since the problem is general, maybe the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element, but with proper memory access patterns.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. Let me think about the indices. For each element C[i][j], the thread would need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

So, the kernel will have to iterate over i and j, and for each, compute the sum over k. But how to structure this in Triton?

Wait, in Triton, the kernel is typically written with a loop over the elements. So, for each element in the output matrix, the kernel would compute it. But for that, the threads need to be arranged such that each thread computes one element.

But for matrix multiplication, the standard approach is to use a block of threads that compute a submatrix. However, given that the problem is general, maybe the kernel is written with each thread computing one element, but with proper memory access patterns.

But for that, the kernel would have to loop over i and j, and for each, loop over k. However, this would be very slow because each thread would have to do K operations. So, perhaps we can optimize by using shared memory to store a slice of A and B, so that each thread can access them more efficiently.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input matrices A and B are stored in global memory. Each thread will need to access A[i][k] and B[k][j] for various k. If we can load these into shared memory, we can access them more quickly.

So, the plan is:

- Each thread block handles a row i of A and a column j of B. Wait, no. Alternatively, each thread block handles a block of rows and columns. But maybe for simplicity, each thread computes one element of C, and uses shared memory to store the necessary parts of A and B.

But how to structure the threads. For example, if we have a block size of 32 threads, each thread could compute one element of C. But then, for each element, the thread would need to iterate over k from 0 to K-1, multiply A[i][k] and B[k][j], and sum them.

But that would be O(K) operations per thread, which is not efficient. So, perhaps we need to find a way to compute the sum more efficiently. Alternatively,

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, matrix multiplication between a MxK matrix and a KxN matrix results in a MxN matrix. So, the output tensor will have shape [M, N]. The kernel needs to compute each element of this output matrix by taking the dot product of the corresponding row from the first matrix and column from the second matrix.

Now, thinking about how Triton works. Triton kernels are written in a way that's similar to CUDA kernels, using threads to process elements. The key is to structure the kernel so that each thread handles a specific element in the output matrix.

Let me recall the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton. Typically, each thread is responsible for computing one element of the output. For that, each thread would iterate over the K elements (the dimension that's being summed over), multiply the corresponding elements from the two input matrices, and sum them up.

But wait, in Triton, we need to make sure that the memory access patterns are optimal. So, the input matrices should be accessed in a way that maximizes coalesced memory access. For the first matrix (MxK), each thread would load a row, and for the second matrix (KxN), each thread would load a column. However, since the second matrix is stored as columns, perhaps we need to transpose it or access it in a way that allows for efficient memory access.

Wait, in Triton, the memory layout is important. If the input matrices are stored in row-major order, then for the first matrix (MxK), each row is contiguous. For the second matrix (KxN), each column is not contiguous, so accessing elements in a column would be non-coalesced. To optimize, perhaps we can transpose the second matrix so that columns become rows, but that would require transposing the matrix, which might not be feasible in the kernel. Alternatively, we can adjust the way we access the second matrix.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a block size that allows for efficient access. Let me think about the block size. For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size of 32 or 64, but that depends on the specific problem. However, in Triton, the block size is a parameter that we can set. Let me think about how to structure the threads.

Each thread in the kernel would be responsible for computing one element of the output matrix. Let's say that each thread is assigned a row index i in the first matrix and a column index j in the second matrix. Then, the thread would compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But to do this efficiently, we need to make sure that for each k, the elements A[i][k] and B[k][j] are accessed in a way that allows for coalesced memory access.

Wait, but for the second matrix (KxN), if it's stored as columns, then for each j, the elements B[k][j] are stored in a column. So, if we have a thread that is processing a particular j, then for each k, accessing B[k][j] would be non-coalesced. However, if we can arrange the threads such that for a given j, multiple threads access consecutive elements in B's column, that would be better.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a different approach where each thread is responsible for a block of K elements. But that might complicate things. Let me think again.

In the standard matrix multiplication, the kernel is structured such that each thread computes one element of the output. The key is to have the threads access the input matrices in a way that allows for coalesced memory access.

Let me outline the steps:

1. The input matrices A (MxK) and B (KxN) are stored in row-major order. So, A[i][k] is stored as A[i*K + k], and B[k][j] is stored as B[k*N + j].

Wait, no. If the matrices are stored in row-major order, then for a matrix with shape (rows, cols), the element at (row, col) is stored at index row * cols + col. So for matrix A (M rows, K columns), the element A[i][k] is at index i*K + k. For matrix B (K rows, N columns), the element B[k][j] is at index k*N + j.

But when accessing B[k][j], for a given j, the elements B[0][j], B[1][j], ..., B[K-1][j] are stored in memory as consecutive elements. So, if we have a thread that is processing a particular j, and for each k, we access B[k][j],

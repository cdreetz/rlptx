Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that adds two 1D tensors element-wise. Let me start by thinking about what operations are required here.

First, the GPU operations. Since it's element-wise addition, each element in the first tensor is added to the corresponding element in the second tensor. So, for each index i, output[i] = input1[i] + input2[i].

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. Both input tensors are 1D with size N. The output tensor will also be 1D of size N. The memory layout is probably contiguous in memory, so we can access them as pointers.

Now, block sizes and memory access patterns. Triton kernels use warps and threads per warp. A common approach is to use a block size that's a multiple of the warp size (32). Let's say BLOCK_SIZE = 256, which is a multiple of 32. But maybe 128 or 256? Let me think. For N elements, each thread can handle a certain number of elements. If the total number of elements is N, then the number of threads per block would be N divided by the number of elements each thread handles. Wait, but in Triton, each thread processes a single element. Wait, no. Wait, in a typical kernel, each thread processes one element. But if the block size is larger, maybe multiple threads can process different elements. Wait, no. For a 1D tensor, each thread would process one element. So, the number of threads per block would be determined by the number of elements. But if N is large, we need to have multiple blocks. So, the kernel will process each element in the tensor, with each thread handling one element.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. So, the kernel will have a loop that iterates over each element in the tensor. Each thread in the block will handle one element. So, the number of threads per block would be the number of elements per block. But if the total number of elements is N, then the number of blocks is ceil(N / BLOCK_SIZE). But in the kernel code, the threads will iterate over the elements, so each thread will process one element. So, the kernel will have a loop over the elements, and each thread will compute one element.

But how to handle the indices? Let me think. In Triton, the kernel is written with a loop that runs for the number of elements. Each thread in the block will have an index, and they process that index. So, for example, in the kernel, we can have:

@triton.jit
def kernel(...):
    pid = tl.program_id(...)  # or something like that
    # compute the index for this thread
    # then load input1 and input2 at that index
    # add them and store to output

Wait, but how to compute the index? Let me think. The kernel is called with the number of elements N. Each thread in the block will have a unique index. So, for example, if the block size is 256, then each block will process 256 elements. But if N is not a multiple of 256, then the last block will process fewer elements.

So, in the kernel, the thread index can be computed as the thread index within the block. Then, the total number of elements is N. So, for each thread, the index is pid (the program id) in the block. Wait, but the program id is per block. So, for each block, the threads are numbered from 0 to (BLOCK_SIZE - 1). Then, the index in the tensor is pid. But then, we need to check if pid is less than N. Otherwise, it's an out-of-bounds access.

So, in the kernel, we need to compute the index for each thread, and then check if it's within the valid range. If it's out of bounds, we can mask it so that the operation doesn't happen.

So, the steps are:

1. For each thread in the block, compute its index in the tensor (pid).
2. Check if the index is within 0 <= index < N. If not, mask the operation.
3. Load input1 and input2 at that index.
4. Add them and store to output.

Now, the memory access. The input tensors are passed as pointers. So, for each index, we can load the value from input1 and input2. But in Triton, the memory is accessed via pointers. So, for example, input1_ptr is a pointer to the first element of the input1 tensor. Then, for index i, the address is input1_ptr + i * element_size. But since the tensors are 1D and contiguous, this is straightforward.

But wait, in Triton

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that adds two 1D tensors element-wise. Let's start by thinking about what operations are needed. The kernel should take two input tensors and produce an output tensor where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements from the inputs.

First, I need to figure out the GPU operations. Since it's element-wise addition, each thread will handle one element. So, each thread will load the value from the first input tensor, the value from the second input tensor, add them, and store the result in the output tensor.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The problem states they are 1D tensors of size N. So, each tensor has a shape of (N,). The kernel needs to process all N elements. The memory layout is probably contiguous in memory, so each tensor is stored as a flat array in memory.

Now, block size and memory access. Triton kernels are divided into warps, and each warp has a certain number of threads. The block size is usually a multiple of the warp size (32). For element-wise operations, a block size of 256 might be good, but maybe 128 or 256. However, since each thread handles one element, the block size can be set to 256, and each thread will process one element. But wait, if the total number of elements is N, then the number of threads per block would be N divided by the number of blocks. But since Triton can handle dynamic numbers, maybe the block size is set to 256, and each thread handles one element. However, if N is not a multiple of 256, the last block will have fewer threads. But in Triton, the kernel is written to handle all elements, so the threads will process the elements in order, and any threads beyond the N elements will not do anything, perhaps with masking.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is launched with a number of blocks, and each block has a certain number of threads. For example, if N is 1000, then the number of blocks would be ceil(N / 256). But the kernel needs to process each element. So each thread will compute one element. So, the kernel's loop would iterate over each element, and each thread is responsible for one element.

But how to handle the indices? Let's think: the kernel is launched with a grid of blocks, and each block has a certain number of threads. For each thread, the index can be computed as the thread index within the block, then multiplied by the number of threads per block. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, each thread can compute its own index as i = tid * blockDim.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x * blockDim.x? No, perhaps better to use the thread index within the block. Wait, in Triton, each thread has a unique index within the block. So, for a block of size 256, each thread has an id from 0 to 255. Then, the global index for the element is blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + tid. But that's if the kernel is written to process each element in order.

Wait, but for a 1D tensor, the kernel needs to process each element in order. So, for each thread, the index is computed as (blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x). Then, the kernel needs to process all elements from 0 to N-1. However, if N is not a multiple of the block size, then some threads in the last block will be processing elements beyond N-1. So, we need to handle that with masking.

So, the steps are:

1. For each thread, compute the index i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x.

2. Check if i is less than N. If not, skip (masking).

3. Load the values from input1 and input2 at index i.

4. Add them and store in output at index i.

But how to handle the input and output tensors. The input tensors are passed as pointers, and each element is accessed via the index. So, in the kernel, for each thread, we need to load input1[i], input2[i], add, and store output[i].

Now, the memory access. Since the tensors are 1D, each element is stored in contiguous memory. So, for a given index i, the address is computed as input1 + i * element_size. But in Triton, the kernel is written in a way that each thread accesses the element at i. However, for performance, it's better to have the threads access the elements in a way that maximizes coalesced memory access. Since each thread is accessing a different element, the memory access is non-coalesced. But for element-wise operations, this is unavoidable. However, if the threads are in a warp, and

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the minimum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the minimum element). So for each row (each M element), I need to compute the min of N elements.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Since we're processing rows, each threadblock should handle one row. But how many threads per block? Let's think about how many elements are in each row. If N is large, we need enough threads to process all elements in a row. Let's choose a block size that's a power of two, maybe 256. But maybe 128 or 256? Let's see. For each row, each thread can process one element. So the number of threads per block should be at least the number of elements in a row. Wait, but if N is larger than the block size, then we need multiple threads per block. Wait, no. Wait, the block size is the number of threads per block. So if each thread handles one element in the row, then the block size should be equal to the number of elements in the row. But that's not feasible if N varies. So perhaps we need to use a dynamic block size. But Triton allows us to set the block size as a constant. So maybe we should choose a block size that's a power of two, say 256, and then for each row, each threadblock processes a chunk of elements. Wait, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread process one element in the row, and the block size is set to 256. But if N is smaller than 256, then the threads in the block will process elements beyond the row's length, which we need to handle with masking.

So, the approach would be: for each row, each threadblock processes the row. Each thread in the block handles one element. But how to manage the threads per block? Let's say we have a block size of 256. For each row, the threads in the block will process elements from 0 to N-1. But if N is less than 256, then some threads will be out of bounds. So we need to mask those out.

So the steps for each threadblock:

1. Determine the row index (i) that the block is responsible for. Since the tensor is [M, N], each row is i, and each element is j in 0..N-1.

2. For each thread in the block, compute the element index j in the row. But since the block has multiple threads, each thread will handle a different j. Wait, but how to distribute the j's across the threads. For example, if the block has 256 threads, then each thread can handle a different j in the row. But if the row has N elements, then the threads in the block will process j from 0 to N-1. But if N is less than 256, then some threads will be out of range. So we need to mask those out.

So, the plan is:

- Each threadblock processes one row (i).
- Each thread in the block is responsible for a single element in the row (j).
- The thread index within the block (tid) is used as j.
- But we need to check if j is within the row's length (N). If not, mask out that element.

But how to compute the row index (i) for the block? Since each block processes one row, the block index (block_idx) can be used to get i. For example, if the block index is (block_idx_x, block_idx_y), then i = block_idx_x. But since we're processing rows, maybe the block is arranged in a way that each block handles one row. So the number of blocks in the x dimension is M, and each block is responsible for one row.

Wait, but in Triton, the grid is determined by the number of blocks. So for a 2D tensor, the grid would be (M, 1), assuming that each block handles one row. But maybe the grid is (M, 1) and each block is responsible for one row. Then, for each block, the row index is the x-coordinate of the block.

So, for each block, the row index i is block_idx.x. Then, for each thread

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is to find the minimum value in each row of the tensor. Since it's a 2D tensor, each row is of length N. So for each row (i.e., each row index M), I need to find the minimum value across all elements in that row.

So the input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Now, considering how Triton works, I need to structure the kernel to process each row. Let's think about the grid and blocks. Since each row is independent, I can process each row in parallel. So the number of blocks should be equal to the number of rows, M. Each block will handle one row.

But wait, Triton's grid is determined by the number of blocks. So if I have M rows, I can launch M blocks, each handling one row. Each block will process the elements in that row.

Now, for each block, I need to process the N elements in the row. The block size should be chosen such that it's efficient. Typically, for such problems, a block size of 256 is common, but I need to check if that fits. However, since each row has N elements, and N can vary, maybe I should use a block size that's a divisor of N? Or maybe not, since the kernel is designed for arbitrary N. But in Triton, the block size is fixed per kernel, so perhaps I should use a block size that's a power of two, or adjust based on N.

Wait, but the kernel is written for a specific N. Wait, no. The kernel is written for a general case. So the block size is chosen based on the problem. For example, if each block processes a certain number of elements in the row, then the number of blocks would be ceil(M / block_size). But in this case, since each row is independent, perhaps each block is responsible for one row. So the grid size is M, and each block processes the entire row.

But how to handle that? Let me think again. Let's say that each block is responsible for processing one row. So for each row i, the block will process all N elements in that row. So the block size can be set to 1, but that's not efficient. Alternatively, maybe the block can process multiple elements in parallel. Wait, but for each row, the elements are processed in sequence. So for each row, we need to find the minimum of N elements. How to do that efficiently in Triton?

An efficient approach for finding the minimum in a row would be to have each thread in the block process a portion of the row. For example, if the block has 256 threads, and the row has N elements, then each thread can process a chunk of elements. But for the minimum, we need to compare all elements. So perhaps the block can process the row in a way that each thread compares a subset of elements and propagates the minimum.

Alternatively, a common approach for min reduction is to have each thread in the block process a portion of the data, and then perform a reduction across the threads. So for example, if the block has 256 threads, and the row has N elements, then each thread can take a chunk of elements, and then the threads compare their results to find the minimum.

But how to structure this? Let me think of the steps:

1. For each row i, we need to find the minimum of the elements in that row.

2. Each block is responsible for processing one row. So for each row, the block will process all elements in that row.

3. The block size can be set to a value that allows for efficient reduction. For example, if the block has 256 threads, then each thread can handle a portion of the row.

But how to split the elements in the row among the threads? Let's say the row has N elements. The number of threads in the block is BLOCK_SIZE. So each thread can handle a chunk of elements. For example, if N is 1024, and the block has 256 threads, each thread can handle 4 elements. Then, each thread computes the minimum of its chunk, and then the threads compare their results to find the overall minimum.

But how to handle when N is not a multiple of the block size? Well, the kernel can handle that by using a mask or by having some threads process fewer elements.

Alternatively, perhaps the block can process the entire row, and each thread is responsible for a single element. But that would be inefficient if the block size is large.

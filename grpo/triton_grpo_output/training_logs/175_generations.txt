Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that does element-wise addition of two 1D tensors. Let me start by thinking about what's required here.

First, the problem is straightforward: add corresponding elements from two input tensors and store the result in an output tensor. But since it's a Triton kernel, I need to make sure the memory access is efficient. Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for GPU parallelism, so I should consider how to structure the threads and memory accesses.

Let me recall the steps. The kernel will process each element in the input tensors. Each thread should handle a single element. But wait, maybe using a block size that's a power of two could help with cache efficiency. But for a simple add, maybe each thread just handles one element. However, in Triton, the block size is set with the @triton.jit decorator, so I need to choose a suitable block size. For example, a block size of 256 might be common, but maybe for this case, since it's a 1D tensor, each thread can handle one element. But I should check.

Wait, the user mentioned efficient memory access. So, if each thread processes one element, then each thread will load the two input elements, add them, and store the result. But for that, the memory access pattern would be sequential, which is good. But maybe there's a way to have multiple threads process elements in a way that uses coalesced memory accesses. However, for a simple add, each thread accessing a single element is straightforward.

So the steps would be:

1. Determine the number of elements N. The kernel will process N elements.
2. Each thread in the block will handle a single element. The block size is set to something like 256, but the exact value depends on the number of elements. But since Triton handles the thread assignment automatically, maybe the block size is just a parameter that we can set. For example, using a block size of 256, but if N is smaller than the block size, the threads will just do nothing. But that's handled by the kernel's logic.

Now, the input and output tensors. The input tensors are 1D, with shape (N,). The output is also (N,). The kernel needs to take these tensors as inputs and outputs.

In Triton, the kernel is written with the @triton.jit decorator. The parameters would be the input tensors, output tensor, and the number of elements N. The kernel will process each element in the input tensors.

Let me think about the memory layout. The tensors are stored in contiguous memory, so each thread can access the ith element by index i. But in Triton, the kernel needs to know the strides of the tensors. However, since they are 1D, the strides are just 1. So, for each thread, the index is i, and the input tensors are accessed as input0[i], input1[i], and the output is output[i].

But how to handle the indices? The kernel will have a loop over the elements, but in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. Wait, no. In Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements, but each thread handles a single element. Wait, no. Wait, in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements, and each thread is responsible for a certain range of elements. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me think again.

In Triton, the kernel is written with a loop that runs for the number of elements, and each thread is responsible for a certain index. For example, in the case of a 1D tensor, each thread can compute the index i = tid * block_size + ... but that's for when you want to process multiple elements per thread. However, for a simple element-wise add, each thread can handle one element. So the kernel would have a loop that runs for each element, and each thread is responsible for a single element. Wait, but how is that structured?

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured with a loop that runs for each element, and each thread is responsible for a single element. But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop that runs for the number of elements, and each thread is assigned a particular index. Wait, maybe I need to use the "num_elements" parameter and have each thread compute its index as i = pid * (num_elements / num_threads) + ... but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is written with a loop over the elements, and each thread is responsible for a single element. But how is that handled in Triton?

Wait, in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop that runs for the number of elements, and each thread is assigned a particular index. For example, the kernel would have

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that adds two 1D tensors element-wise. Let's start by thinking about what operations are needed. The kernel should take two input tensors and produce an output tensor where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements from the inputs.

First, I need to figure out the GPU operations. Since it's element-wise addition, each thread will handle one element. But wait, maybe using shared memory could help with coalesced access. But for a simple case where the tensors are already in global memory, maybe each thread can directly access the elements from global memory. However, if the tensors are large, using shared memory might be more efficient. But the problem says to have efficient memory access patterns, so I should consider how to access the data.

The input and output tensors are 1D, size N. Let's assume they are stored in row-major order, which is standard. Each thread will process one element. So, for each thread, I need to compute i = thread index, then load A[i] and B[i], add them, and store to C[i].

But for Triton, the kernel is written in a way that each thread handles a specific element. The key is to make sure that the memory accesses are coalesced. Since each thread is accessing a different element, if the threads are in a contiguous block, their accesses will be coalesced. But if the threads are spread out, it might not be. However, in a standard 1D loop, each thread is responsible for one element, so the memory access should be coalesced.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is divided into blocks. Let's think about the block size. Let's choose a block size that allows for efficient processing. For example, if the block size is 1024, each thread in the block can handle one element. But maybe that's not optimal. Alternatively, if the block size is larger, like 256, but that might not be necessary here. For a simple add, maybe each thread handles one element, so the block size can be 1, but that's not efficient. Wait, no, in Triton, the block size is determined by the number of threads per block. So, for example, if the kernel is written with a block size of 1, each thread handles one element. But that's not efficient. Wait, maybe I should use a larger block size, but for element-wise operations, each thread can handle one element. But that's not efficient in terms of memory access. Wait, perhaps the problem is that each thread is accessing a single element, which is fine, but if the threads are in a block, they can access consecutive elements in the global memory.

Wait, let me think again. For a 1D tensor, if each thread is responsible for one element, then the memory access is sequential. So, for example, if the thread index is i, then the global memory access is A[i], B[i], and C[i]. But if the threads are in a block, and each thread is assigned a unique i, then the memory accesses are coalesced. So, the key is to make sure that each thread's i is contiguous. So, the kernel should process the elements in a way that each thread's i is consecutive. That's how it's usually done.

So, the steps for the kernel would be:

1. Determine the number of elements N. The kernel should be launched with N threads, but since Triton uses blocks, perhaps the number of blocks is determined by the number of threads per block. For example, if each block has 1024 threads, then the number of blocks is ceil(N / 1024).

But in the kernel code, the threads will be in a block, and each thread will compute its own index. So, the kernel will have a loop over the elements, with each thread handling one element.

But how to compute the index? In Triton, each thread has an index in the block. So, for example, in the kernel, each thread has a tid (thread id within the block), and the block index is computed as blockIdx * blockDim. Then, the global index is blockIdx * blockDim + threadIdx.

But in this case, the kernel is for a 1D tensor. So, the code would be:

for i in range(N):
    a = A[i]
    b = B[i]
    c = a + b
    C[i] = c

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop that runs for each element. However, in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop that is unrolled or not, depending on the block size. Wait, no, Triton uses a different approach. The kernel is written with a loop that runs for each element, but the threads are arranged in a way that each thread processes one element. So, the

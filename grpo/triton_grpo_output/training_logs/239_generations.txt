Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum each column of the 2D tensor. So for each column (which is along the second dimension, since the tensor is [M, N], meaning M rows and N columns), I need to add up all the elements in that column. The output should be a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the sum of the corresponding column.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. The output will be a 1D tensor of shape [M], since each element in the output is the sum of a column. The memory layout is important here. The input is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. For a 2D tensor, the elements are stored as [0, 1, 2, ..., N-1, N, N+1, ...], so the first dimension is rows (M), second is columns (N).

Now, thinking about the kernel's structure. Triton kernels are written with a loop over the grid and blocks. For a sum reduction along the last dimension (columns), each block should process a certain number of columns. But since the reduction is along the last dimension, each thread in the block would handle a single element in a column, and then accumulate the sum.

Wait, but how to organize the threads. Let's think about the problem. For each column j (from 0 to N-1), we need to sum all the elements in that column. So each thread can be responsible for a single element in a column. But since there are M elements per column, each thread would process one element. However, since the kernel is for a 2D tensor, perhaps the threads are organized in a way that each thread handles a single element in the column.

But wait, the kernel is supposed to process the entire tensor. Let me think about the approach. The kernel will process each column, and for each column, sum all the elements in that column. The output is a vector of size M, where each element is the sum of the column.

So the kernel will have to iterate over each column, and for each column, iterate over each row, adding the elements. But that's not efficient. Wait, no, because in a typical reduction, you have multiple threads working on the same data. But here, since the reduction is along the last dimension, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element in a column, and then the threads in the block combine their results.

Alternatively, since the columns are independent, each column can be processed by a separate block. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, each block can process a range of columns, and each thread in the block processes a single element in that column.

Wait, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the tensor. Then, for each column, all threads in the block contribute to the sum of that column. But how to organize this.

Alternatively, think of the kernel as processing each column. For each column, the threads in the block will sum all the elements in that column. But how to do that with Triton.

Wait, here's an approach: the kernel will have each thread process a single element in the tensor. Then, for each column, the threads in the block will add their elements. But since the columns are independent, each column can be processed by a separate block. However, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, each block can process a range of columns, and each thread in the block handles a single element in that column.

But perhaps a better way is to have each thread handle a single element in the tensor, and then the threads in the block combine their results. However, since the sum is along the last dimension, each column is processed by multiple threads. Wait, maybe this is not the right approach.

Alternatively, think of the kernel as processing each column. For each column j, the threads in the block will sum all the elements in that column. So the kernel is structured with a loop over the columns, and for each column, a loop over the rows. But how to do this in Triton.

Alternatively, for each column j, the threads in the block will compute the sum of the elements in that column. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block can handle a column, and each thread in the block handles a row in that column. But that would require that the number of columns is divisible by the number of blocks. But maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, since the kernel is for a 2D tensor, perhaps the kernel is designed such that each thread is responsible for a single element

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum each column of the tensor. So for each column (which is along the N dimension), we need to add up all the elements in that column. The input is a 2D tensor with M rows and N columns. The output should be a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the sum of the corresponding column.

Next, input and output tensor shapes. The input is [M, N], and the output is [M]. The memory layout is probably row-major, so each row is stored contiguously. For a 2D tensor, the elements are stored as [0, 0], [0, 1], ..., [0, N-1], [1, 0], etc. So for a given row i and column j, the index in the tensor is i * N + j. But since we're dealing with a 2D tensor, maybe it's better to think in terms of row and column indices.

Now, the kernel needs to process each column. So for each column j, we need to sum all the elements in that column. But how to structure the threads? Since we're doing a reduction, we need to have each thread handle a part of the data. But since the reduction is along the last dimension (columns), each thread should be responsible for a single column. Wait, no. Wait, the reduction is along the last dimension, which is the columns. So for each column, we need to sum all the elements in that column. So for each column j, we have M elements (rows) in that column. So the kernel needs to process each column, and for each column, sum all the elements in that column.

But how to structure the threads? Let me think. If we have a grid of threads, each thread can handle a column. So for each column j, we have a thread that processes that column. But since the number of columns is N, we need to have N threads. However, in Triton, the kernel is launched with a certain number of blocks and threads per block. So maybe we can have each thread process a single column. But how to handle that?

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the column. But that would be more like a reduction over the rows. Wait, no. Wait, the reduction is along the last dimension (columns), so for each column, we need to sum all the elements in that column. So each column is a separate reduction. So for each column, we can have a thread that accumulates the sum. But how to do that in Triton.

Wait, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single column. So for each column j, we have a thread that reads all the elements in that column and sums them. But that would require each thread to process M elements, which could be expensive. However, if the number of columns is large, this might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread process a block of elements in the column, and then perform a reduction within the thread.

But perhaps a better approach is to have each thread handle a single column, and then accumulate the sum. Let's think about the steps.

First, the kernel needs to process each column. So the number of threads per block should be equal to the number of columns, N. But if N is large, that could be a problem. However, Triton allows for dynamic grid sizes. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread process a single element in the column, and then perform a reduction over the rows. Wait, that's the standard approach for a sum reduction along a dimension.

Wait, the standard approach for a sum reduction along the last dimension (columns) is to have each thread process a single element in the column, and then perform a reduction over the rows. But that would require that each thread is responsible for a single element in the column. However, in that case, the threads would need to be arranged in a way that each thread is responsible for a single element in the column. But since the columns are processed in parallel, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element in the column, and then the threads in the same block perform a reduction over the rows.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. The output is a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the sum of the column j. So for each column j, we need to sum all elements in that column. So for column j, the elements are at positions (0, j), (1, j), ..., (M-1

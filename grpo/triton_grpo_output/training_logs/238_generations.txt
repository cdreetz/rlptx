Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, matrix multiplication between a MxK matrix and a KxN matrix results in a MxN matrix. Each element in the output is the dot product of the corresponding row from the first matrix and column from the second matrix. So, for each element (i, j) in the output, it's the sum over k from 0 to K-1 of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

Now, considering Triton, which is a high-performance GPU programming language, I need to structure the kernel to efficiently compute this. Triton kernels are written in a way that leverages GPU parallelism, so I need to think about how to partition the computation into blocks and threads.

Let me think about the input tensors. The first tensor A is of shape [M, K], and the second tensor B is [K, N]. The output tensor C will be [M, N]. Each thread should compute one element of C. But how to organize the threads?

In Triton, each thread can be assigned a unique (i, j) pair, where i is the row index in C and j is the column index. However, for matrix multiplication, each element in C requires K operations (summing over k). So, the kernel needs to handle this summation efficiently.

But wait, in Triton, each thread can process a single element of C. However, for large K, this might not be efficient. So, perhaps I should use a block size that allows for more efficient memory access. Let me think about the memory layout.

Assuming that the input tensors are stored in row-major order. For tensor A, each row is stored contiguously. Similarly for B. So, for a given i and j, the elements A[i][k] and B[k][j] can be accessed as A[i + i_stride * k] and B[j + j_stride * k], but wait, no. Wait, for A, each row is K elements. So, for a given i, the elements are A[i * K + k], for k in 0..K-1. Similarly for B, each column is N elements, so for a given j, B[k * N + j]. Wait, no, if B is stored in row-major, then each row is N elements. So, for B, the element at (k, j) is B[k * N + j]. Wait, but in the matrix multiplication, the second matrix is K rows and N columns. So, for B, each row is N elements. So, for a given k, the column j is B[k][j], which in row-major is B[k * N + j].

So, for each element C[i][j], the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, for each thread, we need to iterate over k from 0 to K-1, multiply A[i][k] and B[k][j], and sum them up.

But if K is large, this could be slow. So, perhaps we can use a block size that allows for more efficient computation. Let me think about the block size. For example, if each thread handles one k, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each thread can handle multiple k's, but that depends on how the data is laid out.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a block size that allows for each thread to compute a portion of the sum. However, in Triton, each thread is responsible for a single element of the output. So, the kernel would have to loop over k for each (i,j) pair.

But how to structure the kernel. Let me think about the steps.

First, the kernel needs to process each element of C. So, each thread is responsible for one (i,j) pair. Then, for each such pair, the thread needs to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

So, the kernel would have a loop over k, and for each k, load A[i][k] and B[k][j], multiply, and accumulate the sum.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the threads. So, perhaps the kernel is structured as follows:

Each thread is assigned a unique (i, j) pair. Then, for each (i,j), the thread computes the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But how to handle the indices. Let me think about the parameters. The kernel would take the input tensors A and B, and output tensor C. The kernel would have parameters for the dimensions M, K, N. Then, each thread would compute C[i][j].

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works. The result should be a tensor of shape [M, N], where each element is the sum of the products of elements from the first matrix's row and the second matrix's column.

First, I need to figure out the GPU operations required. Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for parallelism, so I should structure the kernel to handle each element of the resulting matrix efficiently. The key is to use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency, especially since matrix multiplication can be memory-intensive.

The input tensors are A (M,K) and B (K,N). The output is C (M,N). Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, for each i and j, we need to compute this sum.

In Triton, I'll need to handle the indices properly. Let's think about how to partition the problem into blocks. A common approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to handle a portion of the matrix. For example, using a block size of 32, which is a common choice for efficient memory access.

Now, the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. So, for A, each row is contiguous in memory. Similarly for B. The output tensor C will also be stored in row-major order.

For shared memory, I need to load slices of A and B into shared memory. Since each thread block will handle a portion of the rows of A and columns of B, I should calculate how much of each matrix to load into shared memory. For example, if the block size is 32, each thread in the block can handle a certain number of elements from A and B.

Wait, but for matrix multiplication, each thread typically handles one element of the result. However, if we use a block size that allows for multiple elements to be processed in parallel, that could be more efficient. Alternatively, using a block size that allows each thread to process a certain number of elements in the inner loop.

Wait, maybe I should structure the kernel such that each thread block handles a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread block can handle a block of size (block_size, block_size) in the result matrix. But I need to make sure that the threads within the block can compute the necessary elements.

Alternatively, each thread can compute one element of the result. But that might be too slow because the inner loop (the sum over k) could be too slow. So, perhaps using a more efficient approach where each thread block handles a block of K elements, and each thread computes a part of the sum.

Wait, but in the standard matrix multiplication, each thread block is responsible for a submatrix of the result. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread block handles a block of size (block_size, block_size) in the result matrix. But that requires that the block size is compatible with the K dimension. So, perhaps the block size is chosen such that it can handle the K dimension.

Alternatively, the block size is chosen such that each thread block handles a certain number of rows from A and columns from B. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread block handles 32 rows of A and 32 columns of B. But that's not possible if K is smaller than 32. So, maybe the block size is set to a value that can be a divisor of K, but that's not necessary. Instead, the block size is chosen based on the number of elements in the inner loop (the K dimension).

Wait, perhaps I should use a block size that allows each thread to process a certain number of elements in the K dimension. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread block can handle 32 elements in the K dimension. But that's not quite right. Let me think again.

In the standard matrix multiplication, each thread block is responsible for a submatrix of the result. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread block handles a block of size (block_size, block_size) in the result matrix. But that would require that the block_size is compatible with the K dimension. However, in this case, the K dimension is the number of columns in A and rows in B. So, for each thread block, the number of rows in A that it handles is block_size, and the number of columns in B that it handles is block_size. Then, each thread in the block would compute one element of the result matrix.

But that would require that the block_size is such that it can

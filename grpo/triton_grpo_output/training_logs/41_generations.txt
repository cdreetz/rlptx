Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in the context of Triton.

First, the matrices are A (MxK) and B (KxN). The result is C (MxN), where each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k. But directly computing this with a naive approach would be slow, so we need to use shared memory and tiling to optimize memory access.

Triton kernels use threads per block, and each thread handles a small tile of the matrix. The key is to divide the matrices into tiles that fit into shared memory. Let's think about the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 is common, but I'll need to decide based on the problem.

Shared memory is used to store tiles of A and B. Each thread in the block will compute a part of the result. The steps are:

1. Load the A and B tiles into shared memory.
2. Compute the dot product of the corresponding rows of A and columns of B.
3. Store the result in C.

But how to structure the threads? Each thread might handle a specific element of the result matrix. However, with tiling, each thread might compute a part of the dot product.

Wait, maybe I should structure the kernel such that each thread block handles a block of rows from A and columns from B. For example, each block computes a submatrix of C. But I need to think about how to partition the matrices into tiles.

Let me consider the tile size. Let's say each tile is of size TILE_M x TILE_K for A and TILE_K x TILE_N for B. But since A is MxK and B is KxN, the tiles would be of size TILE_M x TILE_K and TILE_K x TILE_N. However, the actual tile size depends on the block size and the shared memory capacity.

Alternatively, the kernel might be structured such that each thread block handles a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. For example, each thread block computes a portion of the result matrix C. But I need to make sure that the shared memory is used efficiently.

Let me think about the shared memory. Each thread block will load a tile of A (size TILE_M x TILE_K) and a tile of B (size TILE_K x TILE_N) into shared memory. Then, each thread in the block computes a part of the dot product between a row of A and a column of B.

Wait, maybe each thread is responsible for computing one element of C. But that's the naive approach. To optimize, we need to compute multiple elements in parallel by using shared memory.

Alternatively, each thread in the block could compute a part of the dot product. For example, if the tile size is TILE_K, then each thread in the block could compute a part of the sum for a particular element in C.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. The kernel is launched with grid dimensions based on the matrix dimensions. For example, for C of size MxN, each block handles a block of rows (M_block) and columns (N_block). But this depends on the tile size.

2. Each thread block computes a submatrix of C. For example, if the tile size is TILE_M x TILE_N, then each block handles a TILE_M x TILE_N block of C.

3. Each thread in the block computes a single element of C. However, to optimize, we can use shared memory to store tiles of A and B. For example, each thread block loads a TILE_M x TILE_K tile of A and a TILE_K x TILE_N tile of B into shared memory.

Wait, maybe the tile size for A is TILE_M x TILE_K, and for B it's TILE_K x TILE_N. Then, each thread in the block computes a dot product between a row of A and a column of B. But how?

Let me think of the shared memory as two matrices: A_tile and B_tile. Each thread in the block is responsible for a particular element in C. For example, thread (i, j) in the block computes C[i][j] by summing A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k. But to do this efficiently, we need to load the relevant rows of A and columns of B into shared memory.

Alternatively, each thread could compute a part of the dot product. For example, if the tile size is TILE_K, then each thread in the block computes a part of the sum for a particular element in C.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to have each thread block compute a block of rows from A and columns from B. Let

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that matrix multiplication involves computing each element of the resulting matrix as the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix. Since we're using shared memory, I should think about how to tile the data to maximize memory bandwidth and minimize bank conflicts.

The input tensors are A (M, K) and B (K, N). The output tensor C will be (M, N). Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

For tile-based computation, I need to divide the matrices into tiles. Let's say each tile is of size BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K for matrix A and BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N for matrix B. But since A is MxK and B is KxN, the tiles need to be arranged such that they fit into shared memory.

Wait, shared memory is limited, so the tiles should be small enough to fit. Let's choose a block size, maybe 32 elements per row. So BLOCK_M and BLOCK_K could be 32. But I need to make sure that the tiles are aligned properly.

The kernel should process each element of C. For each row i in A and column j in B, compute the dot product. But with shared memory, I need to load the tiles of A and B into shared memory, then compute the dot product.

So the steps would be:

1. For each row i in A, load the corresponding tile of A into shared memory.
2. For each column j in B, load the corresponding tile of B into shared memory.
3. Compute the dot product between the two tiles, accumulating the result into C.

But how to structure the threads? Each thread can handle a specific element in C. However, with tile-based computation, perhaps each thread block handles a block of rows and columns.

Wait, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread block processes a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. But given that the matrices are MxK and KxN, the tiles need to be arranged so that the shared memory can hold the tiles.

Alternatively, each thread might handle a specific element in C. But with shared memory, it's more efficient to process tiles. Let me think about the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton.

In standard matrix multiplication, each thread computes one element of C. But with shared memory, we can load a block of A and a block of B into shared memory, then compute the dot product over the overlapping elements.

So, for example, each thread block processes a tile of A (say, rows i to i+BLOCK_M-1 and columns j to j+BLOCK_K-1) and a tile of B (rows j to j+BLOCK_K-1 and columns k to k+BLOCK_N-1). Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Actually, the standard approach is to have each thread block handle a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. For example, each thread block is responsible for computing a block of C that is (BLOCK_M x BLOCK_N). To do this, the threads in the block load the corresponding tiles of A and B into shared memory, then compute the dot product for each element in the block.

So, for each thread in the block, it's responsible for computing one element of C. But to do that, the thread needs to access elements from the tile of A and the tile of B. However, since the tiles are of size BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K and BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N, the threads need to compute the dot product over the overlapping elements.

Wait, maybe each thread in the block is responsible for a specific element in C. For example, if the block is responsible for rows i to i+BLOCK_M-1 in A and columns j to j+BLOCK_N-1 in B, then each thread computes C[i][j] by taking the dot product of the row i in A and column j in B. But to do that, the threads need to load the corresponding tiles of A and B into shared memory.

But how to structure this. Let me think about the shared memory. For matrix A, each tile is of size BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K. For matrix B, each tile is of size BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N. So, for each thread block, we can load a tile of A and a tile of B into shared memory. Then, each thread in the block can compute the dot product between the corresponding row of A and column of B.

But how to map the threads to the elements. Let me think about the indices. Suppose the thread block is responsible for computing a block of C that starts at (

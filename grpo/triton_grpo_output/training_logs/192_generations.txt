Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the minimum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the minimum of the elements in that row). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the minimum of N elements.

Now, considering GPU operations. Triton is a GPU programming language, so I need to use its primitives. The kernel will process each row, and for each row, iterate through all elements to find the minimum.

Next, the input and output tensors. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Memory layout: The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. For each row, we need to access all N elements. The output tensor will have one element per row.

Now, block sizes and memory access patterns. Since each row is processed independently, I can have each thread handle a single row. But wait, if each thread handles a row, then the number of threads per block would be M, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each thread handles a single element in a row, but that would require more threads. Wait, but for each row, we need to find the minimum. So perhaps each thread is responsible for a single row, and within that row, the thread processes all elements. But that might not be efficient either. Alternatively, maybe each block processes a row, and within the block, multiple threads process elements of that row. But how?

Alternatively, since each row is independent, we can have each thread handle a single row. But for that, the number of threads per block would be M. But if M is large, that might not be efficient. However, Triton allows for dynamic block sizes. Alternatively, maybe each block processes a row, and each thread in the block processes a single element in that row. But that would require more threads. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the optimal way is to have each thread handle a single element in a row, but since we need to find the minimum, each thread would compare its element with the current minimum. But that would require some coordination. However, for a reduction operation, we can use a standard reduction approach where each thread is responsible for a part of the data.

But in this case, since the reduction is along the last dimension (N), for each row, we need to reduce N elements. So for each row, we can have a reduction over N elements. So for each row, the threads can work together to find the minimum.

So the kernel would have two main parts: for each row, process all elements in that row to find the minimum.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let me think about the kernel structure.

First, the kernel will process each row. So the first step is to determine which row each thread is responsible for. Let's assume that each thread is responsible for a single row. Then, for each row, the thread would process all elements in that row to find the minimum.

But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each block is responsible for a single row, and within the block, multiple threads process elements of that row. But for a row of N elements, how many threads per block? Maybe the block size is set to N, but that depends on the actual N value. However, in Triton, the block size is fixed per kernel, so perhaps we need to choose a block size that can handle the reduction.

Alternatively, for each row, the reduction can be done using a standard reduction approach. For example, for a row of N elements, the number of threads per block would be the number of elements in the row, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, we can use a block size that is a power of two, and use the standard reduction method.

But given that the input is 2D, and the output is 1D, perhaps the kernel can be structured as follows:

Each thread is responsible for a single element in a row. But since the reduction is along the row, each thread would compare its element with the current minimum. However, that would require a lot of threads. Alternatively, we can have each thread handle a part of the row, and then perform a reduction.

Wait, perhaps the kernel can be structured as follows:

- For each row (i) in the input tensor, we need to compute the minimum of the elements in that row.

- Each thread is responsible for a single row. Then, within that row, the thread would process all elements to find the minimum.

But how to do that. For example, if the row has N elements, then each

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the min reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the minimum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the minimum element). So for each row (each M row), we need to compute the minimum of N elements.

Now, considering how Triton works, I need to structure the kernel to process these rows efficiently. The kernel will be launched with a grid that covers all the rows (M rows), and each thread will handle one row. But wait, maybe I should think about how to split the work. Since each row has N elements, and each thread can process a single element, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can process multiple elements per thread, but since we need to find the minimum, it's better to process each element in a row.

Wait, but for a reduction, the standard approach is to have each thread process a portion of the data and then combine results. However, since the reduction is along the last dimension, each row is independent. So for each row, we can compute the minimum of its elements.

So, for each row (let's say row i), we need to find the minimum of the elements from column 0 to N-1. The kernel will have to process each row, and for each row, process all N elements.

But how to structure the threads. Let's think about the grid and the blocks. The grid will have M blocks (each block handling one row). Each block will have multiple threads, but since each row has N elements, maybe each block can have multiple threads processing different elements in the row. But since the reduction is per row, perhaps each thread can process a single element and then combine the results.

Alternatively, since the reduction is along the last dimension, each row is independent, so we can process each row in parallel. So the kernel can be structured with each thread handling a single element in a row, but that might not be efficient. Wait, but for each row, the minimum is computed by comparing all elements. So for each row, we need to find the minimum of N elements. So for each row, we can have a thread that processes all elements, but that's not efficient. Instead, we can use a reduction approach where each thread processes a subset of the elements and combines the results.

But since each row is independent, maybe we can process each row in a way that each thread handles a portion of the elements in the row. However, the standard approach for reduction is to have each thread process a subset of elements and then combine them. For example, in a 1D reduction, each thread might process a block of elements and then combine with others.

So, for a row of N elements, we can split the elements into blocks. Let's say we have a block size of, say, 128. Then for each row, the number of threads per block would be determined by the block size. But since the kernel is written in Triton, we can use the triton's built-in reduction functions or implement the reduction manually.

Wait, but the user wants a kernel that computes the min reduction along the last dimension. So the output will be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

So, the kernel needs to process each row, compute the min of that row, and store the result in the output tensor.

Now, the input tensor is 2D, shape [M, N]. The output is 1D, shape [M].

So, the kernel will have to process each row. Let's think about how to structure the threads. For each row i, we can have a set of threads that process the elements in that row. But how to organize the threads per row.

In Triton, the kernel is launched with a grid of blocks. Each block can have multiple threads. For each row, we can have a block that processes that row. But if the number of rows is M, and each block processes one row, then the grid size would be M blocks. Each block would have a certain number of threads, which would process the elements in the row.

But how to handle the elements in the row. For each row, the elements are in the input tensor's row i. So for row i, the elements are at positions (i, 0), (i, 1), ..., (i, N-1).

So, for each row, the threads in the block would process these elements. Let's say each thread in the block handles a single element. But that would require N threads per block, which could be inefficient if N is large. However, since the kernel is for a single row, perhaps it's better to process the elements in the row using a

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the minimum value in each row of a 2D tensor. Since the tensor is [M, N], each row has N elements, and we need to compute the min for each of the M rows.

So, the input is a 2D tensor with shape (M, N), and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape (M,), where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Now, considering how Triton kernels work. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA, but with more flexibility. The kernel will process elements in blocks, and each block will handle a certain number of rows.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensor is 2D, so in Triton, we can access it as a 2D grid. Each thread will process a specific element in the tensor. But since we're doing a reduction (min), each thread needs to compare values and track the minimum.

But wait, for a reduction, we need to have each thread process a part of the data and combine results. However, since we're doing a row-wise reduction, each row is independent. So for each row, we can process all elements in that row and compute the minimum.

But how to structure this in Triton? Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The kernel will take the input tensor, the number of rows (M), and the number of columns (N). The output tensor will be of size M.

In Triton, each thread is identified by its index in the thread block. So, for each row, we can have multiple threads working on that row. But since each row is independent, maybe we can process each row in a separate block. However, since the kernel is launched with a certain number of blocks, we need to make sure that each block handles a row.

Alternatively, perhaps each block processes a row. Let me think: if we have M rows, and each block handles one row, then the number of blocks would be M. Each block would process N elements in that row.

But how to structure the threads within a block. For example, if each block has multiple threads, each thread could handle a specific element in the row. But since we need to compute the minimum of the row, we need to have all elements in the row processed.

Wait, but for a reduction, we can use a parallel reduction approach. For each row, we can have multiple threads that compute the minimum. For example, if the row has N elements, and we have multiple threads per block, each thread can take a portion of the elements and compute the minimum.

But how to handle that. Let me think about the steps:

1. For each row i in 0..M-1:
   a. For each element in the row, compute the minimum.
   b. The result for the row is the minimum of all elements.

So, the kernel needs to process each row independently. So, each block can be responsible for processing a single row. But how to structure the threads within the block.

Alternatively, each block could process a range of elements in the row. But for a row-wise reduction, perhaps it's better to have each thread handle a single element in the row and then perform a reduction across the threads in the block.

But for that, the number of threads per block needs to be a power of two, so that the reduction can be done in a tree-like structure. However, since the number of elements per row (N) can be arbitrary, we need to choose a block size that can handle that.

But perhaps the optimal approach is to have each block handle a single row, and within the block, the threads perform a reduction over the elements of that row.

So, for each row, the block has multiple threads, each processing a portion of the row. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block can process up to 128 elements in the row. But if the row has more elements than that, we need to have multiple blocks per row. Wait, no. Each block is responsible for a single row, so the block's threads process the elements of that row.

Wait, but if the row has N elements, and each block has K threads, then each thread would process a portion of the row. For example, if K is 128, then each thread would process a certain number of elements in the row, and then perform a reduction.

But how to structure that. Let me think about the steps for a single row.

Let's say we have a row with N elements. We can have multiple threads in the block, each responsible for a subset of the elements. For example, if

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the min reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the minimum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor). So for each row (each M element), I need to find the minimum of all N elements in that row.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Memory layout: The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. The output is a 1D array where each element corresponds to a row's minimum.

Optimal block sizes and memory access. Since we're processing each row independently, each block can handle one row. But since each row has N elements, the block size should be chosen to efficiently process N elements. However, since each row is processed independently, maybe each thread can handle one element in the row. Wait, but for a reduction, we need to find the minimum across all elements in the row. So perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element, and then we perform a reduction across the threads in the block.

Wait, but for a min reduction, the standard approach is to have each thread process a portion of the data, and then perform a reduction. But in this case, since each row is independent, maybe each block can handle one row. Let me think: for each row, we need to compute the minimum of N elements. So, for each row, we can have a block of threads that compute the minimum across all elements in that row.

But how to structure the threads. Let's say each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. Then, the threads in the block would reduce the minimum across all elements. But for that, the number of threads per block should be a power of two, so that the reduction can be done efficiently. Alternatively, maybe each block handles one row, and the threads in the block work together to compute the minimum of that row.

But how to map the threads to the elements in the row. Let's say each thread is assigned a position in the row. For example, for a row with N elements, each thread processes one element. Then, the threads in the block perform a reduction to find the minimum.

But for that, the block size should be chosen such that it can handle the reduction. Let's say the block size is 1024, but that's arbitrary. Alternatively, the block size could be set to a power of two, like 256, 512, etc. But the exact value depends on the N. However, since N can vary, perhaps we need to use a dynamic block size.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread processes a single element in the row, and then the threads in the block reduce the minimum. For example, if there are N elements in the row, and the block has K threads, then each thread is responsible for a certain range of elements. But that might complicate things. Alternatively, for each row, the threads in the block work together to compute the minimum. So, for each row, the threads in the block process the elements of that row, and the block's output is the minimum of that row.

But how to handle the rows. Since the input is [M, N], each row is of length N. So, for each row i, we need to compute the min of the elements from i*N to (i+1)*N in the input tensor.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written in a way that each thread is assigned a specific index. So perhaps the kernel is structured as follows:

- The kernel is launched with M rows. Each row is processed by a block of threads. Each thread in the block is responsible for a specific element in the row.

But how to assign the threads to the elements. Let me think: For each row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j, where j ranges from 0 to N-1. So, for each row i, the kernel needs to process all j in 0..N-1.

But how to structure the threads. Let me consider that each block is responsible for processing one row. So, for each row i, the block processes that row. The number of threads per block would be N, but that's not efficient. Alternatively, the number of threads per block is a power of two, and the threads in the block work together to compute the minimum of the row.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is designed such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then the threads in the block perform a reduction

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in Triton.

First, the input tensors are A (M x K) and B (K x N). The result is C (M x N), where each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k. But doing this naively would be too slow, so we need to use shared memory and tile-based computation.

Triton kernels work with threads in blocks. Each thread block handles a portion of the matrix. For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to divide the matrices into tiles. Each tile is stored in shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.

Let me think about the steps:

1. **Memory Layout**: The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. For shared memory, I'll need to load tiles of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K) for A and (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N) for B. Wait, but the tiles for A and B need to be compatible with the matrix dimensions. Maybe the tile size for A is (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K) and for B is (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N), but I need to make sure that the tiles fit into the shared memory.

Wait, the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to use a block size that allows for efficient computation. The block size is usually chosen as a multiple of the tile size. For example, if the tile size is 32x32, then the block size is 128, but that's a bit arbitrary. Alternatively, the block size is chosen based on the problem size. But the user mentioned tile-based computation with shared memory, so I need to define the tile size.

Let me recall the standard approach. For matrix multiplication, each thread block handles a tile of A and a tile of B. The tile size is usually set to a value that fits into the shared memory. For example, if the block size is 128, then the tile size could be 16x16, but I need to check the memory constraints.

But the user says to use tile-based computation with shared memory. So, the kernel will process tiles of A and B, compute the product, and store the result in C.

So, the steps for the kernel:

- Each thread block processes a tile of A and a tile of B. The tile size is determined by the block size. For example, if the block size is 128, then the tile size could be 16x16, but that depends on the actual problem size.

Wait, maybe I should define the tile size as (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K) for A and (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N) for B. But how do I determine the tile size? The tile size is usually chosen as a multiple of the block size. Alternatively, the block size is chosen such that the threads can compute the product efficiently.

Alternatively, the standard approach is to use a block size of 128, and tile size of 16x16. But I need to make sure that the shared memory can hold the tiles.

Let me think about the memory layout. For each thread block, we load a tile of A (size BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K) into shared memory. Similarly, a tile of B (size BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N) is loaded into shared memory. Then, each thread in the block computes a portion of the result matrix C.

Wait, but how does the thread block compute the result? Each thread in the block would compute a single element of C. But that's not efficient. Instead, the threads should compute multiple elements. Wait, maybe the threads are arranged in a way that each thread computes a single element of C, but that's not the case. In the standard approach, each thread computes a single element of C, but with the use of shared memory to store the tiles.

Wait, no. In the standard matrix multiplication, each thread computes a single element of C. However, with tile-based computation, the threads can compute multiple elements by using the tiles. But I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

In the standard matrix multiplication using shared memory, each thread block processes a tile of A and a tile of B. The tile size is determined by the block size. For example, if the block size is 128, then the tile size could be 16x16. Then, each thread in the block computes a single element of the result matrix C. However, the threads are arranged in such a way that they can compute multiple elements by using the tiles.

Alternatively, the block size is set to a size that allows for efficient computation. For example, if the block size is

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in the context of Triton.

First, matrix multiplication between A (MxK) and B (KxN) results in a C (MxN) matrix. Each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k from 0 to K-1. But doing this naively would be too slow, so we need to use shared memory and tiling to optimize.

Tiling involves dividing the matrices into smaller blocks (tiles) that fit into shared memory. The idea is to load a tile of A and a tile of B into shared memory, compute the product, and then write the result back to global memory. This reduces the number of global memory accesses, which are slower.

So, the steps would be:

1. Determine the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 is common. Let's pick 32 as a starting point. But maybe 128? Wait, the problem says tile-based computation with shared memory. So the block size should be such that each thread block can handle a tile of size (block_size x block_size). Let me think: the threads in a warp can process multiple elements. But for matrix multiplication, each thread might handle one element of the result. However, with shared memory, each thread can process a portion of the tile.

Wait, in standard matrix multiplication with shared memory, each thread block processes a tile of A and B. The threads in the block are divided into rows and columns. For example, if the tile size is (block_size x block_size), then each thread computes one element of the result. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe the block size is chosen such that each thread handles a certain number of elements.

Alternatively, perhaps the block size is 128, and each thread block handles a tile of size (128 x 128). Then, each thread computes one element of the result. But that might not be the most efficient. However, for the purpose of this problem, the exact block size is up to me to choose, but I need to make sure that the kernel is efficient.

Let me think about the shared memory. The shared memory is used to store tiles of A and B. For each tile, we can load a block of A and B into shared memory, compute the product, and then write the result to global memory.

So, the kernel will have to:

- For each tile of A and B, load them into shared memory.
- Compute the product of the tiles.
- Write the result to the output matrix.

But how to structure the threads? Each thread block will handle a tile of A and B. The threads in the block will compute the elements of the result matrix.

Wait, perhaps the kernel is structured as follows: each thread block is responsible for computing a block of the output matrix. The threads in the block are arranged in a grid that allows them to compute the elements of the output matrix.

But I need to think about the indices. Let's say the output matrix is C with dimensions M x N. Each element C[i][j] is computed as the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

In the shared memory approach, each thread block handles a tile of A and B. Let's assume that the tile size is (block_size x block_size). So, for the matrix A (M x K), each tile is of size (block_size x block_size), and similarly for B (K x N). The output matrix C will have tiles of size (block_size x block_size).

But how to map the threads to the tiles? For example, each thread in the block could be responsible for computing a single element of the output matrix. However, that would require that the threads are arranged in a grid that covers the output matrix.

Alternatively, each thread could be responsible for a block of the output matrix. But that might not be efficient.

Alternatively, each thread block processes a tile of A and a tile of B, and computes the product for that tile. But that requires that the tiles are aligned in such a way that the threads can compute the product efficiently.

Let me think about the parameters. The input tensors A and B are of shapes [M, K] and [K, N], respectively. The output tensor C is [M, N].

So, the kernel will have to iterate over the elements of C. Each element C[i][j] is computed as the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

In the shared memory approach, each thread block will process a tile of A and B. Let's assume that

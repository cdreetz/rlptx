Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in Triton.

First, the input tensors are A (M,K) and B (K,N). The output is C (M,N), where each element C[i,j] is the sum of A[i,k] * B[k,j] for all k. But since we're using shared memory, we need to break this into tiles. 

Triton kernels typically use blocks that process a portion of the matrix. For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that allows for efficient memory access. Let's think about the block size. Usually, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 is used. Let's pick 32 as the block size for this example. Wait, but the exact block size depends on the dimensions. Maybe I should use a block size that can handle the tiles of A and B. 

Shared memory is used to store tiles of the matrices. So for each block, we'll load a tile of A and a tile of B into shared memory. Then, we perform the multiplication and accumulation in shared memory. The key is to make sure that the memory accesses are coalesced and that we can efficiently compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the block size. Let's say each block processes a tile of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N) for the output. Wait, maybe it's better to use a block size that can handle the tiles of A and B. For example, each block could process a tile of A (of size BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K) and a tile of B (BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N). But I need to make sure that the block can handle the multiplication efficiently.

Wait, in standard matrix multiplication, each block computes a portion of the output matrix. The block size is usually chosen such that the number of elements processed per block is manageable. For example, if the block size is 32, then each block would handle 32x32 elements. But since we're using shared memory, the tile size should be such that the shared memory can hold the tiles.

Let me think about the shared memory layout. For matrix A (M,K), each tile would be of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K). Similarly, for matrix B (K,N), each tile is (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N). The output matrix C (M,N) would have tiles of (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N). 

So, the kernel will process each tile of C, and for each tile, it will compute the product of the corresponding tiles of A and B. 

But how to structure the kernel? The kernel should have a loop over the output matrix C, and for each tile, load the corresponding tiles of A and B into shared memory, perform the multiplication, and then write the result back to global memory.

But in Triton, the kernel is written in a way that each thread handles a specific element in the output matrix. Wait, no. Actually, in matrix multiplication, each thread block is responsible for computing a submatrix of C. So the kernel would have a loop over the rows of C, and for each row, a loop over the columns. But that might not be efficient. Instead, the standard approach is to have each thread block compute a tile of C, and each thread within the block computes a specific element of that tile.

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured such that each thread block processes a tile of C, and each thread in the block computes a specific element of that tile. However, for the matrix multiplication, the threads need to compute the dot product between a row of A and a column of B.

So, the kernel would have:

- For each block, compute the tile of C that it's responsible for. The block's position in the grid determines which tile it's handling.

- For each thread in the block, compute the element C[i,j] by multiplying A[i,k] * B[k,j] and summing over k.

But with shared memory, the idea is to load a tile of A and a tile of B into shared memory, then compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B.

Wait, but how to structure the threads. Let me think again. In the standard approach, each thread block is responsible for computing a block of C. The block size is typically (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N), where BLOCK_M and BLOCK_N are the number of rows and columns in the tile of C. Each thread in the block is responsible for a specific element in the tile. However, for matrix multiplication, the threads need to compute the dot product between a row of A and a column of B. So the threads in the block would be

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The user mentioned using tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through how to approach this.

First, I remember that matrix multiplication involves multiplying elements of the first matrix with corresponding elements of the second matrix and summing the products. For two matrices A (MxK) and B (KxN), the result C will be (MxN). Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But since we're using Triton, which is a GPU programming framework, I need to think about how to efficiently compute this using shared memory and tiling. Shared memory is faster than global memory, so I should load chunks of data into shared memory to minimize global memory accesses.

The key steps would be:

1. Determine the block size. For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that allows for efficient computation. Maybe 32 elements per block? Or maybe 16? I need to choose a block size that allows for efficient tiling. Let's say 32, but I need to check if that's a good fit.

2. The kernel will process each element of the resulting matrix. Each thread in the block will compute a part of the result. But since the matrices are large, we need to tile them. So, each thread will handle a small tile of the matrices.

Wait, in matrix multiplication, each thread usually handles a single element of the result. But with tiling, we can load a block of A and B into shared memory, compute the product, and then store the result. However, for a general case, maybe each thread is responsible for a small tile of the result.

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element of the result. But that's not efficient for large matrices. So, using a block size that allows for multiple elements to be computed in parallel.

Wait, in the standard approach for Triton matrix multiplication, each thread computes a single element of the result. But with shared memory, we can load a block of A and B into shared memory, compute the product, and then accumulate the result. However, for that, the block size needs to be chosen such that each thread can process a small tile.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured so that each thread is responsible for a single element of the result. Let me think about the dimensions.

Let me think about the input tensors. The first tensor is A with shape [M, K], and the second is B with shape [K, N]. The result is C with shape [M, N]. Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

In Triton, each thread will handle a single element of C. So, for each thread, we need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. But if K is large, this sum could be expensive. So, using shared memory to store a block of A and B would help.

So, the approach is to split the matrices into tiles. For example, each thread block processes a tile of A and B, and computes the corresponding part of C. But how to structure this.

Alternatively, the standard approach for Triton matrix multiplication is to have each thread compute a single element of C. But with shared memory, we can load a block of A and B into shared memory, and then compute the sum over k. But for that, the block size needs to be such that each thread can process a small number of elements.

Let me think about the block size. Let's say each thread block has 32 threads. Each thread will compute a single element of C. But for that, the threads need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. However, if K is large, this sum would require many memory accesses. So, to optimize, we can load a block of A and B into shared memory, and then each thread can compute the sum over the elements in the block.

Wait, maybe the tile size is chosen such that each thread can process a small tile of the matrices. For example, if the tile size is 16x16, then each thread can compute a part of the sum. But I need to think about the exact structure.

Alternatively, the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to use a block size that allows for each thread to compute a single element of the result. So, each thread is responsible for a single element of C. But to compute that, the thread needs to access K elements from A and B. However, with K being large, this would be inefficient. Therefore, the solution is to use shared memory to store a block of A and B, and compute the sum over the elements

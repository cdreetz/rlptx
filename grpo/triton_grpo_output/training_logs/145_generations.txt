Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the maximum element). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the max of N elements.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the max of the corresponding row.

Memory layout: The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. For each row, we need to process all N elements. The output tensor will have one element per row.

Optimal block sizes and memory access. Since each row has N elements, and we need to process all of them, the block size should be chosen such that each thread handles a portion of the elements. However, since we need to find the maximum, it's similar to a parallel reduction. But since each row is independent, maybe we can process each row in parallel. Wait, but for each row, we need to process all N elements. So maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, we can use a reduction approach where each thread processes a chunk of elements and combines the results.

Wait, but for the max reduction along a row, the standard approach is to use a reduction. For example, in a row of N elements, we can split the elements into pairs, compare them, and keep the max, then repeat this process until we get the max of the row. But for that, the number of threads per row would need to be a power of two, or at least handle the reduction properly.

But since the rows are independent, perhaps we can process each row in parallel. So, for each row, we have a set of threads that work on that row. But how to structure this in Triton?

Alternatively, think of the kernel as processing each row. Each thread is responsible for a single row. Wait, but the rows are M in number, so if we have M rows, each thread can handle one row. But then, for each row, the thread would need to process all N elements to find the max. That might not be efficient, as each thread would have to process N elements, which could be a lot. But perhaps for small N, that's manageable. However, for large N, this might not be optimal.

Alternatively, we can structure the kernel such that each thread is responsible for a certain number of elements in a row. For example, if we have a block size of 128, then each thread can process a chunk of elements in the row. But this requires that the number of elements per row is a multiple of the block size. But since N can be arbitrary, perhaps we need to handle that with some masking.

Alternatively, for each row, we can perform a reduction. For example, for a row of N elements, we can use a reduction kernel where each thread takes a portion of the elements and combines them. But how to structure that in Triton.

Wait, the problem is that for each row, we need to compute the max. So, for each row, the kernel must process all N elements. But how to do that in Triton. Let me think of the kernel's parameters.

The input tensor is of shape [M, N]. So, the kernel will have to process each row. Let's assume that the kernel is launched with M threads, each handling one row. Then, for each row, the thread would process all N elements. But that's not efficient for large N. However, maybe for the purpose of this problem, we can proceed with that approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel can be structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, but that would require that each thread processes all elements in the row. But that's not efficient.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of the standard way to do a max reduction along a dimension. For a 2D tensor, the max along the last dimension (columns) would be a 1D tensor of size M. So, for each row, we need to compute the maximum of N elements.

In Triton, the kernel can be structured with each thread handling a row. So, the kernel would have M threads, each processing their own row. For each row, the thread would process all N elements to find the max.

But how to structure that in code. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The input is a 2D tensor, and the output is a 1D tensor. The kernel would need to iterate

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the maximum element). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the maximum of N elements.

Next, input and output shapes. The input tensor is [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the maximum of the corresponding row.

Memory layout: The input is stored in a 2D grid, so in Triton, we can think of it as a matrix. Each thread will handle one row. But since we need to process all elements in a row, maybe each threadblock processes one row. Wait, but for a row of N elements, how many threads do we need? If each thread processes one element, then for N elements per row, we need N threads per row. But that might be inefficient. Alternatively, maybe we can process in blocks of size BLOCK_SIZE, but since the row length is N, which could be variable, perhaps we need to handle it with a loop over the elements in the row.

But wait, the problem is that for each row, we need to find the maximum. So for each row, we can have a threadblock that processes all elements in that row. But how to structure that.

Alternatively, maybe each threadblock processes a single row, and within the threadblock, the threads process the elements of that row. But how to do that.

Let me think about the approach. For each row (i.e., each row index m), we need to compute the maximum of the elements in that row. So for each row, we can have a threadblock that processes all elements in that row. But how to split the work.

Alternatively, perhaps each threadblock processes a block of elements in the row. But since the row length is N, which can be arbitrary, maybe we need to use a loop over the elements in the row. So for each row, we can have a threadblock that iterates through all the elements in that row, and finds the maximum.

But how to structure that in Triton. Let me recall that Triton kernels are written with a grid and a block structure, and each threadblock has a certain number of threads. So for each row, we can have a threadblock that processes that row. But how to handle that.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each threadblock handles a single row. So the number of threadblocks is M, and each threadblock processes one row. Then, within each threadblock, the threads process the elements of that row.

But how to do that. Let's think about the thread indices. For each threadblock, the row index is determined by the threadblock's position in the grid. Then, within the threadblock, each thread processes a certain element in the row.

But for a row of N elements, if the threadblock has, say, 128 threads, then each thread would process a single element. But that's possible. However, for N elements, the number of threads per threadblock would be N, but that depends on N. So perhaps we need to use a dynamic approach.

Alternatively, maybe each threadblock processes a block of elements in the row. But that might not be efficient if N is not a multiple of the block size. But perhaps we can handle that with a loop.

Wait, maybe the approach is to have each threadblock process a single row. Then, for each row, the threads in the threadblock iterate through the elements of that row. But how to do that.

Let me think about the code structure. The kernel would have a grid of M threadblocks, each processing a row. Then, within each threadblock, the threads process the elements of that row. But how to map the thread index to the element in the row.

Alternatively, maybe each threadblock is responsible for a single row. Then, the threads in the threadblock can work together to compute the maximum. For example, if the threadblock has 128 threads, then each thread can take a portion of the row. But how to split the row into chunks.

Alternatively, maybe each thread in the threadblock is responsible for a single element in the row. So for a row of N elements, each thread in the threadblock processes one element. But that would require that the number of threads in the threadblock is equal to N. However, since N can be arbitrary, this might not be feasible. So perhaps we need to use a loop over the elements of the row.

But how to do that in Triton. Let me recall that in Triton, each thread has a thread index, and we can

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to compute the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. So for each row (each M element), I need to sum all the elements in that row and then divide by N. Since it's a mean, I have to handle the division properly, but maybe I can do it as a sum divided by N.

Next, the input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels use threads per block, so I need to decide on a block size. Let's say each block handles a certain number of rows. Since each row has N elements, I need to process N elements per row. But how to structure the threads? Maybe each thread processes one element in a row. But if I have multiple threads per row, that could be efficient.

Wait, for each row, we need to sum N elements. So perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. But if the block size is large enough, maybe we can have multiple threads per row. But for simplicity, maybe each thread handles one element. But that might not be optimal. Alternatively, maybe each thread handles a chunk of elements. But since N can be variable, perhaps it's better to have each thread process one element, and then the block sums them up.

But for a 2D tensor, the rows are along the first dimension. So each row is M elements. Wait, no, the tensor is [M, N], so each row has N elements. So for each row i, we have elements from i*N to (i+1)*N. Wait, no, if it's stored as a 2D array, then each row is a contiguous block of N elements. So for row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j for j from 0 to N-1.

So for each row, we need to sum all N elements. Then divide by N. So the kernel needs to process each row, sum the elements, and then compute the mean.

So the kernel will have to iterate over each row, and for each row, sum the elements. Then divide by N. But how to structure this in Triton.

In Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows. Each thread can handle one row. Wait, but if there are M rows, and each thread handles one row, then the number of threads per block would be M. But that depends on how many blocks we have. Alternatively, maybe we can have each block handle a certain number of rows, and each thread within the block handles a single element in a row.

Alternatively, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element in a row. But that might not be efficient. Let me think.

Let me consider the kernel structure. The kernel will have to process each row. For each row, we need to sum all N elements. So for each row i, we need to read N elements, sum them, then divide by N.

So the kernel can be structured as follows:

- The kernel is launched with M rows. Each thread is responsible for processing one row. But if the number of threads per block is too large, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each block processes a certain number of rows, and each thread in the block processes a single element in those rows.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured with threads per row. For example, each row has N elements, and each thread in the block processes one element. Then, the block sums the elements for that row. But that would require that the number of threads per block is N. But if N is large, that might not be efficient. However, Triton can handle that.

But let's think about the parameters. The input tensor is [M, N], and the output is [M]. So each row is processed, and the sum is computed. So the kernel needs to process each row.

So, perhaps the kernel is structured with a loop over the rows. Each thread is responsible for a single row. Then, for each row, the thread reads all N elements and sums them. Then, the thread writes the sum to the output tensor, and then divides by N.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The kernel will need to take the input tensor, the output tensor, the number of rows M, and the number of columns N.

So the kernel would be something like:

@triton.jit
def kernel(input, output, M, N):
    row = tl.arange(0,

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is to calculate the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. Since the tensor is [M, N], each row has N elements, and we need to sum each row and then divide by N. But wait, the question says "mean reduction along the last dimension", which for a 2D tensor would mean averaging across the columns (the second dimension). So for each row (first dimension), we sum all elements in that row and divide by N.

So the kernel needs to process each row. Let me think about the steps:

1. The input tensor is 2D, with shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

2. For each row i in 0 to M-1, we need to sum all elements in that row (from column 0 to N-1), then divide by N.

Now, considering Triton's kernel structure. The kernel will be launched with a grid that covers all rows. Each thread will handle one row. But how to structure the threads?

Let me think about the block size. Since each row has N elements, and each thread can process a single element, but maybe it's more efficient to have each thread process a single element. However, if N is large, maybe we can have multiple threads per row. But for simplicity, perhaps each thread handles one element in the row. Wait, but for a row, each thread would process one element, and then accumulate the sum. But if the row has N elements, and each thread handles one, then the number of threads per row is N. However, with Triton, the kernel is divided into blocks, and each block can have multiple threads. So perhaps we can have each block process a row, with each thread handling one element in that row.

But wait, the problem is that for each row, the number of elements is N. So if we have a block size of, say, 128, then each block can process up to 128 elements. But since each row has N elements, the number of blocks per row would be ceil(N / BLOCK_SIZE). However, if N is not a multiple of BLOCK_SIZE, then some threads in the last block would have to handle fewer elements. But how to handle that?

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. So for each row, the threads process each element. But how to structure that in Triton.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread processes a single element in the row. Then, for each row, the threads are in a block, and they compute the sum for that row.

But how to handle the row index. Let me think about the parameters for the kernel.

The kernel will need to know the input tensor, the output tensor, the dimensions M and N. Also, the kernel will need to process each row.

So, the kernel's parameters would be:

- input: the 2D tensor [M, N]
- output: the 1D tensor [M]
- M: number of rows
- N: number of columns

But in Triton, the kernel is written with parameters that are passed in. So the kernel function will be something like:

@triton.jit
def kernel(input, output, M, N, ...):

But I need to figure out the parameters. Also, the kernel needs to be launched with a grid that covers all rows. So the grid size would be M, and each block processes one row.

But how to structure the threads in the block. For each row, the threads in the block will process each element in that row. So for a row i, the threads in the block will process elements from column 0 to N-1.

But how to compute the column index for each thread. Let's think: for a block, each thread has a thread index within the block. For example, if the block size is 128, then each thread in the block has an index from 0 to 127. But for a row with N elements, the thread index can be used as the column index. However, if N is smaller than the block size, then some threads in the block will be out of bounds. So we need to handle that with masking.

So, the steps for each thread in the block:

1. Compute the row index i. Since each block processes one row, the row index is determined by the block's index. Wait, no. Wait, in Triton, the grid is divided into blocks, and each block is assigned a thread index. So for a grid of size M, each block is assigned a row index.

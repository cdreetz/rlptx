Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through the steps.

First, the GPU operations. Matrix multiplication involves computing each element of the resulting matrix as the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second. Since we're using shared memory, I'll need to load chunks of data into shared memory to optimize memory access.

The input tensors are A (M,K) and B (K,N). The output is C (M,N). Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. But with tile-based computation, I'll process tiles of size, say, TILE_M x TILE_K for A and TILE_K x TILE_N for B. Wait, but the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton uses tiles that fit into shared memory. So, perhaps I should split the matrices into tiles of size TILE_M x TILE_K for A and TILE_K x TILE_N for B. Then, each thread block handles a tile of the output matrix.

Wait, but the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton uses a block size that allows for efficient computation. Let me recall: the common approach is to have each thread block compute a block of the output matrix. For example, each thread block handles a block of size (TILE_M, TILE_N) in the output. Then, the tiles of A and B are loaded into shared memory. The threads in the block compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B.

But in this case, the input matrices are A (M,K) and B (K,N). So the output is (M,N). So for each element in the output, we need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. The challenge is to compute this efficiently with shared memory.

So, the steps would be:

1. For each thread block, compute a block of the output matrix. Let's say the block size is TILE_M x TILE_N. But since the matrices are A (M,K) and B (K,N), the tile size for A and B would be TILE_K x TILE_K? Wait, maybe I need to adjust the tile sizes based on the dimensions. Let me think.

Alternatively, the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton uses a block size that allows for efficient computation. For example, each thread block computes a block of the output matrix of size (TILE_M, TILE_N). Then, the tiles of A and B are loaded into shared memory. Each thread in the block computes a dot product between a row of A and a column of B.

But in this case, the matrices are A (M,K) and B (K,N). So, the output is (M,N). So for each element C[i][j], it's the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, the key is to process each element in the output matrix by computing the dot product of the corresponding row in A and column in B.

But with shared memory, we need to load the tiles of A and B into shared memory. Let's say each thread block processes a block of the output matrix. For example, each block handles a block of size (TILE_M, TILE_N) in the output. Then, for each element in this block, we need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But the problem is that the matrices A and B have dimensions M x K and K x N. So, the tile sizes for A and B should be chosen such that they fit into shared memory. Let's assume that the tile size for A is TILE_K x TILE_K, but that might not be right. Wait, maybe the tile size for A is TILE_M x TILE_K, and for B it's TILE_K x TILE_N. Then, each thread block processes a block of the output matrix of size TILE_M x TILE_N.

Wait, perhaps I need to split the matrices into tiles that fit into shared memory. For example, for matrix A (M,K), each tile is of size TILE_M x TILE_K. Similarly, matrix B (K,N) is split into tiles of size TILE_K x TILE_N. Then, each thread block computes a block of the output matrix of size TILE_M x TILE_N.

But how does this work? Let me think about the threads. Each thread in the block would compute a single element of the output matrix. For example, each thread computes C[i][j] by computing the dot product of row i of A and column j of B. However, to do this efficiently, we need to load the relevant tiles into shared memory.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread block compute a block of the output matrix, and

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The user mentioned using tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that matrix multiplication involves computing the dot product of rows from the first matrix and columns from the second matrix. For efficiency, especially on GPUs, using shared memory is crucial to reduce global memory access latency. So, I'll need to load chunks (tiles) of the input matrices into shared memory.

The input tensors are A (M x K) and B (K x N). The output is C (M x N), where each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. 

In Triton, I'll need to structure the kernel to handle each element of C. The kernel should process elements in blocks, using shared memory for A and B tiles. The block size should be chosen to maximize throughput, maybe 32 or 64 elements per thread, but I need to check.

Let me think about the memory layout. For matrix multiplication, each thread can handle a block of elements. Let's say each thread is responsible for a tile of size (block_size, block_size). But since A is M x K and B is K x N, the tiles need to be aligned such that the rows of A and columns of B can be processed.

Wait, the standard approach for matrix multiplication with shared memory is to split the matrices into tiles. For each tile of A (size block_size x block_size) and B (block_size x block_size), the threads compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B. But since K might be larger than block_size, we need to process multiple tiles.

But in this case, the user specified tile-based computation with shared memory. So, the kernel should process each element of C by loading a tile of A and a tile of B into shared memory, compute the dot product, and then store the result in C.

But how to structure the threads? Each thread can handle a single element of C. However, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, each thread can handle a block of elements. Let me recall the standard approach for Triton matrix multiplication.

In the standard Triton matrix multiplication, each thread is responsible for a single element in the output matrix. But with shared memory, the threads load a tile of A and a tile of B. For example, if the block size is 32, each thread would compute the dot product of a row from A and a column from B, but that's for a block of elements. Wait, no, maybe each thread computes a single element, but uses shared memory to load the necessary parts of A and B.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread computes a block of elements in C. But I think the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element, but using shared memory for the tiles.

Wait, maybe the kernel is structured as follows: For each element (i, j) in C, the thread computes the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. To do this efficiently, we can load a tile of A and a tile of B into shared memory. The tile size is determined by the block size. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread would load a 32x32 tile of A and B into shared memory, and compute the dot product of the rows of A and columns of B.

But how does this fit into the kernel's structure? Let me think about the parameters. The kernel will need to handle the indices i and j for the output matrix C. Each thread will compute one element of C. However, to compute that element, the thread needs to access A[i][k] and B[k][j] for all k. But if K is large, this would be slow. So, using shared memory to store a tile of A and B can help.

So, the kernel will have to:

1. For each thread, determine which element of C it's responsible for (i, j).
2. Load the corresponding rows of A and columns of B into shared memory.
3. Compute the dot product of these rows and columns, summing the products.
4. Store the result in C.

But how to structure the shared memory? Let's say each thread loads a block of K elements from A and B. Wait, but if K is larger than the block size, then multiple tiles are needed. However, the kernel is designed for a single tile. So, perhaps the kernel is designed for a single tile of A and B, and the threads compute the dot product for that tile.

Alternatively, the kernel is designed for a single element of C. Let me think about the parameters.

The kernel will be called with the shapes of A (M,

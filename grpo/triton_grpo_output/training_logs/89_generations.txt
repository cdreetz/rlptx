Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by understanding what's required here. Matrix multiplication involves taking the dot product of rows from the first matrix and columns from the second matrix. So, for each element in the resulting matrix of shape [M, N], I need to compute the sum of the products of corresponding elements from the two input matrices.

First, I should figure out the GPU operations needed. Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for parallelism, so I need to structure the kernel to handle this efficiently. The key is to partition the computation into blocks where each block can process a portion of the matrices.

Let me think about the input tensors. The first tensor is A with shape [M, K], and the second is B with shape [K, N]. The output tensor C will be [M, N]. Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

In Triton, I'll need to use shared memory to avoid global memory access latency. So, each thread block will handle a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. The block size is important here. Let's say each block processes a certain number of rows from A and columns from B. The block size should be chosen to maximize memory throughput, maybe 32 or 64 elements per thread.

Wait, the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to use a block size that allows each thread to compute a portion of the result. For example, each thread block might handle a submatrix of A and B, and each thread in the block computes a part of the result. But since the matrices are [M, K] and [K, N], maybe the block size should be such that each thread handles a certain number of elements in the K dimension.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. So, for A, each row is contiguous in memory. Similarly for B. The output tensor C will also be stored in row-major order.

Now, for the kernel, I need to determine the indices for each thread. Let's say each thread block handles a certain number of rows from A (say, m) and columns from B (n). But since the matrices are [M, K] and [K, N], the K dimension is the same for both. Wait, no, the first matrix is [M, K], so each row is K elements. The second is [K, N], so each column is K elements.

Wait, maybe the standard approach is to have each thread block handle a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. For example, each block processes a submatrix of A (rows i to i+block_size-1) and a submatrix of B (columns j to j+block_size-1). Then, each thread in the block computes a part of the result.

But in this case, since the matrices are [M, K] and [K, N], the K dimension is the same for both. So, the threads would need to compute the dot product over the K dimension. So, each thread in the block would handle a certain number of elements in the K dimension.

Alternatively, maybe the block size is chosen such that each thread computes a portion of the K dimension. For example, if the block size is 32, each thread would handle 32 elements in the K dimension. But that depends on the size of K.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread block process a block of rows from A (say, m rows) and a block of columns from B (n columns), and each thread in the block computes a part of the result. But for the dot product, each thread would need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, each thread would need to process a certain number of k elements.

So, the block size should be chosen such that each thread can process a chunk of the K dimension. For example, if K is large, each thread can process a certain number of elements in the K dimension, and the threads in the block work together to compute the sum.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let me recall that in Triton, each thread in a block can have its own index. So, perhaps the block size is set to a value that allows each thread to process a certain number of elements in the K dimension. For example, if the block size is 32, each thread would process 32 elements in the K dimension, and the threads in the block would compute the sum over those elements.

But I need to make sure that the threads are properly aligned. Let me think about the parameters for the kernel. The kernel will take the input tensors

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first tensor is MxK, the second is KxN, so the result should be MxN. Each element in the output is the sum of the product of elements from the first row of the first matrix and the corresponding column of the second matrix.

Now, considering how to implement this in Triton. Triton is a high-performance GPU programming language, so I need to optimize for memory access and parallelism.

Let me recall the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton. Typically, each thread block handles a block of rows and columns. For example, each thread might handle a single element of the output matrix. But with large matrices, this can be inefficient. However, since the problem here is general, maybe we can use a more efficient approach.

Wait, but for the given problem, the matrices are MxK and KxN. So the first matrix has M rows and K columns, the second has K rows and N columns. The result is M rows and N columns. So each element in the result is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j], where i is the row index in the result, j is the column index, and k is the summation index.

In Triton, each thread can compute one element of the result. But for large K, this could be slow. However, since the user hasn't specified any particular optimizations (like transpose or using shared memory), maybe we can proceed with the straightforward approach.

So, the kernel needs to process each element of the output matrix. Each thread will compute one element. The threads will be arranged in a grid that covers all the elements of the output matrix.

But how to structure the threads? For each element (i, j) in the output matrix, the thread will compute the sum over k from 0 to K-1 of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But in Triton, threads are organized in blocks. So, perhaps each block handles a certain range of rows and columns. However, for this problem, since the matrices are MxK and KxN, maybe the block size can be adjusted to handle the K dimension efficiently.

Alternatively, perhaps using a block size that allows for efficient memory access. Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors are stored in row-major order, which is the default in most systems. So for the first matrix A (MxK), each row is stored contiguously. Similarly for B (KxN), each row is contiguous.

But for the matrix multiplication, each thread needs to access A[i][k] and B[k][j] for each k. So for a given i and j, the thread needs to iterate over k, and for each k, load A[i][k] and B[k][j], multiply them, and accumulate the sum.

But if K is large, this could be slow. However, in Triton, we can use a block size that allows for multiple threads to work on the same row or column, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe using a block size that allows for each thread to handle a single k, but that might not be efficient.

Alternatively, maybe using a block size that allows for each thread to handle a single element of the output, and then compute the sum over k. But for that, the thread would need to iterate over k, which could be slow if K is large.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written in a way that each thread is responsible for a single element of the output. So, for each element (i, j), the thread would compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. However, this approach would have each thread iterate over k, which could be slow if K is large. So, perhaps we need to find a way to optimize this.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a more efficient approach by using shared memory. For example, if the matrices are large, we can load the rows of A into shared memory and the columns of B into shared memory, then perform the multiplication in shared memory. But that would require transposing B, which might be more complex.

But the user hasn't mentioned any specific optimizations, so perhaps the straightforward approach is better, even if it's not the most optimized.

So, the plan is:

- Each thread computes one element of the output matrix (i, j).
- For that element, the thread iterates over k from 0 to K-1, loads A[i][k] and B[k][j], multiplies them, and accumulates the sum.

But in Triton, the threads are organized in a grid. So the grid should have M rows and N columns, each thread

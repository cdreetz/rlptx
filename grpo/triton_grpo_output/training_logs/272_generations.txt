Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum each column of the tensor. So for each column (which is along the N dimension), we need to add up all the elements in that column. The input is a 2D tensor with M rows and N columns. The output should be a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the sum of the corresponding column.

Next, input and output shapes. The input tensor is [M, N], and the output is [M]. The memory layout is probably row-major, so each row is stored contiguously. For a 2D tensor, the element at (i, j) is stored at position i*N + j. But in Triton, when we handle tensors, we need to make sure we access them correctly.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Since we're doing a reduction along the last dimension (N), each block should handle a certain number of columns. Wait, no. Wait, the reduction is along the last dimension, which is N. So each block will process a certain number of elements in the column. Wait, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element in the column, and then we reduce across threads. Or maybe each block processes a single column and sums all elements in that column.

Wait, the problem is to sum each column. So for each column j (from 0 to N-1), sum all elements in that column. So for each column, we need to sum M elements. But if we have multiple threads per block, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element in the column, and then the block reduces them. But that would require each block to handle a single column. Alternatively, maybe each block handles multiple columns, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, since the reduction is along the last dimension, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element in the column, and then the block reduces across all threads in the block. But for that, the threads in the block would need to process elements in the same column. Wait, but if the column is N, then each column has M elements. So for each column j, we need to sum all elements in that column. So for each column, the threads in the block would process the elements in that column. But how to map this.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the column, and then the block reduces across all threads in the block. But that would require that each thread is assigned a unique element in the column. However, since the column has M elements, and each block has a certain number of threads, perhaps the block is responsible for a single column. For example, if the block size is 1024, then each block handles a single column, and each thread in the block processes one element in that column. But that would require that the number of blocks is equal to N, which is the number of columns. But that might not be efficient if N is large.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each block processes multiple columns. But that might complicate the reduction. Wait, maybe the problem is better approached by having each thread process a single element in the column, and then the block reduces across all threads in the block. But for that, the threads in the block would need to process elements from the same column. However, that would require that each block is assigned a single column, and each thread in the block processes one element in that column. So for example, if the block has 1024 threads, and each thread processes one element in the column, then each block would handle one column. But then the number of blocks would be N, which is the number of columns. However, if N is large, that might not be efficient.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured to have each thread process a single element in the column, and then the block reduces across all threads in the block. But that would require that each thread is assigned a different element in the same column. But how to do that.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed to process each column in parallel. For each column j, we have a set of threads that sum the elements in that column. So for each column j, the threads in the block process the elements in that column. But how to map the threads to the elements in the column.

Wait, perhaps the key is to realize that for each column j, the elements are in positions (i, j) for i from 0 to M-1. So for each column j, the sum is the sum of all elements in that column. So the kernel needs to compute for each j, the sum over i of A[i][j].

So the approach would be:

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum each column of the tensor. So for each column (which is the last dimension), we need to add up all the elements in that column. The input is a 2D tensor with M rows and N columns. The output should be a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the sum of the corresponding column.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The input is [M, N], and the output is [M]. The memory layout is probably row-major, so each row is contiguous in memory. For a 2D tensor, the element at (i, j) is stored at index i*N + j. But in Triton, when we pass the tensor, we need to make sure we access it correctly.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Since we're doing a sum along the last dimension, each thread should handle a single column. But how to organize the threads? Maybe each threadblock handles a single column. Wait, but if the number of columns (N) is large, we might need multiple threadblocks. Alternatively, maybe each threadblock processes multiple columns, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, each threadblock can handle one column, and the number of threadblocks is equal to the number of columns. But that might not be efficient if N is large. Alternatively, maybe each threadblock processes a range of columns, but that's more complex. Alternatively, maybe we can have each threadblock handle a single column, and the number of threadblocks is N. But for large N, that could be a lot of threadblocks. Hmm, maybe a better approach is to have each threadblock process a single column, and the number of threadblocks is N. But that's not efficient for large N. Alternatively, maybe each threadblock processes multiple columns, but that would require more complex synchronization. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread process a single element in the column, and the threads are organized in a way that they can sum their elements. But how?

Wait, the standard approach for sum reduction in Triton is to have each threadblock process a range of elements. For example, in a 1D reduction, each threadblock processes a portion of the data, and then combines the results. But here, since the reduction is along the last dimension (columns), each column is a separate reduction. So maybe each threadblock is responsible for summing a single column. But how to handle that?

Alternatively, maybe we can have each threadblock process a single column, and each thread in the block handles a single element in that column. But that might not be efficient. Let me think again.

Wait, the input is a 2D tensor. For each column j (from 0 to N-1), we need to sum all elements in that column. So for each column, the elements are at positions (i, j) for i from 0 to M-1. So the sum for column j is sum_{i=0}^{M-1} A[i][j].

So, for each column j, we can have a threadblock that sums all the elements in that column. But how to organize this. The number of columns is N, so if we have N threadblocks, each handling one column. But if N is large, that might be a lot of threadblocks, but Triton can handle that.

Alternatively, maybe each threadblock handles multiple columns. But that would complicate the code. Let's think about the standard approach for sum reduction in Triton. For example, in a 1D reduction, each threadblock processes a range of elements, and the threads in the block work together to sum them. But here, since the reduction is along the last dimension, perhaps each threadblock is responsible for a single column, and each thread in the block processes a single element in that column. Wait, but that would require that each threadblock has enough threads to process all elements in the column. For example, if the column has M elements, then each threadblock would need to have M threads. But that's not efficient, as the number of threads per block is limited (usually 1024). So if M is large, that's not feasible. Alternatively, maybe the threads in the block work together to sum the elements in the column. For example, using a reduction within the threadblock.

But how to do that. Let's think of the problem as follows: for each column j, we need to sum all elements in that column. So for each column, we can have a threadblock that processes all elements in that column, and then the result is stored in the output.

But how to handle that. Let's think of the kernel as

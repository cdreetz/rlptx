Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The two input matrices are A (M x K) and B (K x N). The result is a matrix C (M x N) where each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k. But since we're using Triton, I need to optimize this with shared memory and tiling.

Triton kernels work with threads, so I need to figure out how to partition the computation into blocks. The key is to use shared memory to store tiles of the matrices, which reduces the number of global memory accesses. The standard approach is to split the matrices into tiles of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), where BLOCK_SIZE is typically 32 or 64.

Let me recall the steps for matrix multiplication with shared memory. For each block of threads, they compute a tile of the result matrix. Each thread in the block computes one element of the result. But since the matrices are large, we need to load the tiles into shared memory, compute the product, and then write back the results.

So, the first thing is to determine the block size. Let's say BLOCK_SIZE is 32. Then, each thread in the block will handle a portion of the matrix. But how to organize the threads into blocks?

The kernel will be structured with a loop over the rows of the result matrix. Each thread in the block computes one element of C. But for matrix multiplication, the threads need to compute the dot product between a row of A and a column of B. However, with shared memory, we can load a tile of A and a tile of B into shared memory, then compute the dot product between the corresponding rows and columns.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the tile size. Let's say each tile is of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). For matrix A (M x K), each tile is a block of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), and similarly for B (K x N). The result matrix C (M x N) will have tiles of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) as well.

So, the kernel will process each tile of C. Each thread in the block will compute one element of the tile. But how to manage the indices?

Let me think about the indices. For each thread in the block, the thread index within the block is (thread_id_x, thread_id_y). The block index in the grid is (block_id_m, block_id_k, block_id_n), but maybe I need to structure the loops differently.

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured to loop over the rows of A and columns of B. But with shared memory, the threads will load a tile of A and a tile of B, then compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B.

Wait, here's a standard approach for matrix multiplication with shared memory:

- Each thread in the block computes one element of the result matrix.
- The block is responsible for computing a tile of the result matrix.
- The tiles of A and B are loaded into shared memory.
- For each element in the tile, the thread computes the dot product between the corresponding row of A and column of B.

But the problem is that for each element in the tile, the thread needs to access K elements from A and B. However, with shared memory, we can load a block of A and B into shared memory, and then compute the dot product.

Wait, maybe the standard approach is to split the matrices into tiles of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). For each tile of A (size BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE), and each tile of B (size BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE), the product is a tile of size BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE. Each thread in the block computes one element of the product tile.

But how to map the thread indices to the elements in the tiles. Let's say the block is responsible for computing a tile of C starting at (m, n) in the result matrix. Then, each thread in the block computes C[m + m_offset][n + n_offset], where m_offset and n_offset are the offsets within the tile.

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured to process each row of A and each column of B. But with shared memory, the threads can load a block of A and B into shared memory, then compute the dot product.

Let me outline the steps:

1. The kernel is written with a loop over the rows of A (i) and columns of B (j). For each i and j, compute the dot product of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k.

But with shared memory, we can load a tile

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two matrices with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The user wants tile-based computation using shared memory. Let me think through the steps.

First, I remember that matrix multiplication involves computing each element of the resulting matrix as the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix. But with large matrices, it's inefficient to do this directly. So, using tiles and shared memory is a good approach to optimize memory access and reduce latency.

The two input matrices are A (MxK) and B (KxN). The output matrix C will be MxN. Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

For tile-based computation, I'll divide the matrices into smaller tiles. The idea is to load a block of A and B into shared memory, compute the dot product for the tiles, and then store the results back into global memory.

I need to decide on the block size. Common choices are 128 or 256, but maybe 128 is better for this case. Let's say each thread block processes a tile of size (block_size, block_size). But I need to make sure that the tiles fit into shared memory.

The shared memory will store a block of A and a block of B. Let's assume that each tile is of size (block_size, block_size). For matrix A, each tile is (block_size, block_size), and for B, it's (block_size, block_size). But since A is MxK and B is KxN, the tiles need to be aligned such that the rows of A and columns of B can be processed.

Wait, maybe I should think about how the threads are organized. Each thread in the block will compute a single element of the result matrix. But that's not efficient. Instead, each thread should compute a part of the dot product. For example, each thread could handle a single element in the tile of A and B, and accumulate the sum.

Alternatively, using a block of threads to compute a single element of C. But that's not efficient. Maybe each thread block handles a tile of A and a tile of B, and computes the dot product for that tile. But I need to think about the dimensions.

Let me think about the indices. For each element C[i][j], it's the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, for a given i and j, the threads need to compute the sum over k. But with shared memory, I can load a block of A and B into shared memory, and then compute the dot product for that block.

Wait, the standard approach for matrix multiplication with shared memory is to split the matrices into tiles. For example, if the block size is 128, each thread block processes a tile of A (size 128x128) and a tile of B (size 128x128). Then, each thread in the block computes a part of the dot product.

But for the given problem, the matrices are A (MxK) and B (KxN). So, the tiles need to be aligned such that the rows of A and columns of B can be processed.

Let me think about the shared memory. Each thread block will load a tile of A and a tile of B into shared memory. Then, for each element in the output matrix, the threads compute the sum.

Wait, maybe the threads are arranged in a way that each thread computes a single element of the result. But that's not efficient. Instead, each thread should compute a part of the dot product. For example, if the block size is 128, each thread block has 128 threads, and each thread handles a single element in the result matrix.

But that's not efficient. The standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element of the result matrix by iterating over the K elements. But that's not efficient because it's a lot of memory accesses.

Alternatively, the threads can be organized in a way that each thread computes a part of the dot product. For example, each thread block has multiple threads that compute the sum for a particular element of C.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use a block size of 128, and each thread block handles a tile of A and a tile of B. Then, each thread in the block computes a part of the dot product.

But I need to think about the memory layout. Let's assume that the matrices are stored in row-major order. For matrix A (MxK), each row is stored contiguously. For matrix B (KxN), each column is stored contiguously.

In shared memory, each thread block will load a tile of A and a tile of B.

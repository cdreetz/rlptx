Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that matrix multiplication involves computing the dot product of rows from the first matrix and columns from the second matrix. For efficient computation on GPUs, especially with Triton, using shared memory and tiling is essential to minimize global memory access and maximize throughput.

So the input tensors are A (M, K) and B (K, N). The output tensor C will be (M, N). Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

In Triton, each kernel launch is handled by multiple threads. To optimize, I should divide the problem into tiles. The idea is to process small blocks (tiles) of the matrices, store them in shared memory, and then compute the dot product within each tile.

First, I need to determine the block size. A common choice is 32 or 64 elements per thread, but for matrix multiplication, maybe 16 or 32 elements per thread in each dimension. Let me think: for each thread, it might handle a small portion of the matrix. Let's say each thread is responsible for a block of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N), where BLOCK_M and BLOCK_N are the number of rows and columns each thread processes. Wait, but in matrix multiplication, each thread might compute a single element of the output. However, with tiling, threads can work on different tiles.

Alternatively, using a tile-based approach where each thread block processes a tile of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N) in the output matrix. But I need to make sure that the shared memory is used efficiently.

Wait, the standard approach for matrix multiplication with Triton is to split the matrices into tiles, load them into shared memory, and compute the dot product. For example, each thread block handles a tile of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N) in the output matrix. But in this case, the matrices A and B are of sizes (M, K) and (K, N), so the tile size should be such that the tiles fit into shared memory.

Let me think about the shared memory. For each thread block, we can load a tile of A (size BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K) and a tile of B (size BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N) into shared memory. Then, for each element in the output tile, compute the dot product of the corresponding rows from A and columns from B.

But the problem here is that the matrices A and B are of sizes (M, K) and (K, N), so the tile size for A should be (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K), and for B (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N). However, the actual tile size depends on the block size and how the threads are arranged.

Wait, maybe I should use a block size of 16x16, but that might not be optimal. Alternatively, use a block size of 32x32. But I need to make sure that the tiles fit into shared memory. Let's assume that each tile is of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K) for matrix A and (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N) for matrix B. Then, each thread in the block would compute a single element of the output matrix.

But how to structure the threads? Each thread would be responsible for computing a single element of the output matrix. However, with tiling, each thread would compute a portion of the dot product. Wait, maybe the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element, but with tiling, the threads would process different tiles.

Alternatively, the kernel should be structured such that each thread block processes a tile of the output matrix. For example, the output matrix C is divided into tiles of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N). Each thread block handles one such tile. For each tile, we load the corresponding rows from A and columns from B into shared memory, compute the dot product, and store the result in the output.

But the problem is that A is of size (M, K) and B is (K, N). So, for each tile in the output, the rows of A are of size K, and the columns of B are of size K. So, the tile size for A and B should be such that they fit into shared memory.

Let me think about the shared memory. For matrix A, each thread block would load a tile of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K), where BLOCK_M is the number of rows in the tile, and BLOCK_K is the number of columns. Similarly for matrix B, each tile would be (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N). Then, the dot product between a row of A and a column of B would be computed by each thread.

Wait, but in the standard

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two matrices: one with shape [M, K] and the other with [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. Matrix multiplication involves multiplying elements of the first matrix (A) with elements of the second matrix (B) and summing the products. Since we're using shared memory, I should figure out how to partition the matrices into tiles. The standard approach is to split each matrix into blocks that fit into shared memory. The block size is usually a multiple of the warp size, so maybe 32 or 64 elements per block. Let's say each tile is of size BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K for matrix A and BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N for matrix B. Wait, no, maybe the block size for each matrix should be such that the tiles can be stored in shared memory. For example, if the block size is 32x32, then each tile of A would be 32x32, and similarly for B.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The input tensors are A (M, K) and B (K, N). The output is C (M, N), where each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. The shared memory will hold tiles of A and B. So, for each thread, I need to compute a part of the output matrix.

Now, the block sizes. Let's assume that each thread block processes a tile of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K) for matrix A and (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N) for matrix B. The number of threads per block would be BLOCK_M * BLOCK_K, but that might be too large. Wait, maybe I should use a grid of threads where each thread block handles a tile of A and a tile of B. Alternatively, maybe each thread block processes a tile of A and a tile of B, and the threads within the block compute the product. But I need to think about how to split the matrices into tiles.

The key is to use shared memory for the tiles. So, for each thread in the block, it would load a portion of A and B into shared memory, then compute the dot product of the corresponding rows and columns. But how to organize this?

Let me think about the indices. Suppose that each thread is responsible for computing a particular element in the output matrix. However, with tile-based computation, each thread block would handle a block of rows in A and a block of columns in B. Wait, maybe the threads are grouped into blocks where each block handles a tile of A and a tile of B. For example, each thread block would process a tile of A (size BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K) and a tile of B (size BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N). Then, the output tile would be BLOCK_M x BLOCK_N. But how to compute that?

Alternatively, perhaps each thread block handles a tile of A and a tile of B, and the threads within the block compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B. So, for each thread in the block, it would compute a part of the output tile. But how to split this into threads?

Wait, maybe the standard approach is to have each thread block process a tile of A (size BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K) and a tile of B (size BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N). Then, the output tile is BLOCK_M x BLOCK_N. Each thread in the block would compute a single element of the output tile. But that might not be efficient, as each thread would need to compute a single element, which could be slow. Alternatively, maybe the threads are arranged in a way that each thread computes a part of the dot product.

Alternatively, perhaps the threads are arranged in a grid where each thread block handles a block of rows in A and a block of columns in B. For example, if the output matrix C is M x N, then each thread block could handle a block of M rows and N columns. But that might not fit with the tile-based approach.

Alternatively, think of the matrix multiplication as follows: for each element C[i][j], it's the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. To compute this efficiently, we can split the matrices into tiles. Let's say that each tile of A is of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K), and each tile of B is of size (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N). Then, for each tile of A and B, the output tile would be (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N). The threads in the block would compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B.

But how to arrange the threads? For example, if the block size is BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K, then each thread would handle a certain row of A and a certain column

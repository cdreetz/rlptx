Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let's break this down step by step.

First, understanding the problem: The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and I need to compute the sum along the N dimension. So for each row (since the last dimension is N), I sum all the elements in that row. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding row.

Next, thinking about GPU operations. Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for parallelism. So I need to figure out how to partition the work across threads. Since each row is independent, each thread can handle a single row. But how many threads per block? Typically, for such reductions, you might use a block size that's a power of two, but since the rows are independent, maybe each thread can handle one row. Wait, but if M is large, maybe we need to have multiple threads per block. Wait, but for a sum reduction along the last dimension, each thread can process a single element in the row, but since we need to sum all elements in the row, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element and then we need to accumulate the sum. Wait, no. Wait, the sum along the last dimension (N) for each row (M) would be, for each row, sum all N elements. So for each row, we need to add all elements in that row. So each thread can be responsible for a single element in the row, but then how do we combine them? Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps each thread can handle a single row, and then compute the sum of that row. But if the row has N elements, then each thread would need to process all N elements. But that would be inefficient. Wait, maybe I need to think of it as each thread processing a single element in the row, and then combining the sums. Wait, but for a row, the sum is the sum of all elements in that row. So if each thread is responsible for a single element, then we need to accumulate the sum for that row. But how to do that in Triton.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel can be structured such that each thread is responsible for a single row. Then, for each row, the thread would load all N elements and sum them. But that would require each thread to process N elements, which might be inefficient if N is large. However, for a 2D tensor, each row is contiguous in memory. So perhaps each thread can process a single row, and then compute the sum of that row by loading all elements in the row and adding them up.

But how to handle that in Triton. Let's think about the memory layout. The input tensor is [M, N], so each row is stored as a contiguous block of N elements. So for a given row i, the elements are at positions i*N to i*N + N - 1.

So, for each thread, if we can compute the sum of elements in row i, then we can do that. But how to do that in Triton. The kernel will have a loop over the rows, and for each row, sum all elements.

But in Triton, each thread is assigned a unique index. So perhaps the kernel is designed to process each row in parallel. So the kernel's thread index is the row index. Then, for each row, the thread would load all elements in that row and sum them.

But how to handle that. Let's think about the kernel parameters. The input tensor is a 2D tensor, so in Triton, we can pass it as a pointer, and then the row and column indices can be computed.

But for each row, the thread would need to iterate over all N elements in that row, sum them. However, if N is large, this would be a lot of operations per thread, which might be inefficient. But maybe for the sake of simplicity, given that the problem is to sum along the last dimension, this is acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a more optimized approach where each thread is responsible for a single element, and then combine the sums. But that would require a reduction across the elements in the row. But since the rows are independent, perhaps we can do that.

Wait, but the problem is that each row is processed independently, so for each row, we can perform a reduction of the elements in that row. So for each row, we can have a reduction over the N elements. But how to do that in Triton. Let's think about the kernel structure.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the number of rows M. Each thread is responsible for a single row.

2. For each row, iterate over all elements in that row

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum each column of the tensor. So for each column (which is along the second dimension, since the tensor is [M, N]), we need to add up all the elements in that column. So for each row in the first dimension (M), we'll have a column in the second dimension (N). Wait, no, actually, the last dimension is N. So the sum is over the N dimension. So for each row in the M dimension, we sum across the N elements. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the tensor is [M, N], so the last dimension is N. So the sum is along the N dimension. So each element in the first dimension (M) will have a sum of all elements in that row. Wait, no, if the tensor is [M, N], then each row is of length N. So summing along the last dimension (N) would mean for each row (M), sum all elements in that row. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, if the tensor is [M, N], then the last dimension is N. So summing along the last dimension would mean for each element in the first dimension (M), sum all elements in that row. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, if the tensor is [M, N], then each row is of length N. So summing along the last dimension (N) would mean that for each row (M), we sum all N elements. So the result would be a tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding row. Wait, but the user said "sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]". So the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each entry is the sum of the elements in the corresponding row. Wait, no. Wait, if the tensor is [M, N], then the last dimension is N. So summing along that dimension would collapse it to [M]. So yes, each entry in the output is the sum of the elements in the row. So the kernel needs to compute for each row, the sum of all elements in that row.

So the input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output is a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding row.

Now, the Triton kernel needs to process this. Let's think about how to structure the kernel.

In Triton, each thread block processes a certain number of elements. For a sum reduction, we can use a block size that allows each thread to handle a portion of the data. But since we're summing along the last dimension (N), each row is of length N. So for each row, we need to sum all N elements. But how to handle that in a kernel.

Wait, but if we have a 2D tensor, and we want to sum along the last dimension, perhaps the kernel can be designed to process each row. So for each row, the threads in the block can compute the sum of that row.

But how to structure the threads. Let's think about the block size. Let's say the block size is 128. Each thread in the block can handle a certain number of elements in the row. But since the row has N elements, we can split the row into chunks that each thread processes. However, if N is not a multiple of the block size, we need to handle that with masking.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel can be designed such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then the threads in the block sum their values. But that would require that each thread processes one element, and then the block's threads sum their contributions. But that's possible.

But for a row of N elements, if each thread processes one element, then the number of threads per block would be N. But that's not feasible if N is large. So perhaps a better approach is to have each thread process a chunk of elements in the row, and then the block sums those chunks.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel can be structured to process each row, and for each row, the threads in the block compute the sum. Let's think about the data layout.

The input tensor is [M, N], and the output is [M]. So for each row i (from 0 to M-1), we need to sum all elements in that row.

So the kernel needs to process each row. So for each row, the threads in the block can compute the sum of that row.

But how to structure the threads. Let's think about the kernel's parameters

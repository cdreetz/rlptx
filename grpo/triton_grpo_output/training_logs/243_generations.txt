Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the max of the elements in that row). So for each row, we need to compute the maximum of N elements.

Triton kernels work with threads in blocks, so I need to figure out how to structure the threads to handle this. Since each row is independent, each thread can handle a single row. But wait, maybe it's better to have each thread process a single element in the row, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each thread can be responsible for a single row, and then compute the max for that row.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, if each thread is responsible for a single element, then we need to have N threads per row. But if the rows are M in number, then the total number of threads would be M*N. However, Triton kernels are typically structured with a grid of blocks, each block processing a certain number of elements. So maybe I need to structure the kernel such that each block processes a single row, and within the block, the threads compute the max for that row.

But how to do that? Let me think. For each row, we need to compute the maximum of N elements. So for each row, we can have a block of threads, each thread handling a single element. But then, for each row, we need to have N threads. However, if the number of threads per block is fixed, maybe we can set the block size to a value that allows us to process each row efficiently.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then the threads in the block collaborate to compute the maximum. But for that, the block size needs to be chosen such that each block can handle a row. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block can process up to 128 elements in a row. But if the row has N elements, then the number of blocks needed per row would be ceil(N / block_size). But that might complicate things.

Wait, but in this case, the rows are of length N. So for each row, the number of elements is N. So for each row, the maximum can be computed by having a block of threads that each take a portion of the row and then compute the max.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. Then, for each row, the threads in the block would compute the max by comparing their elements. But how to do that?

Let me think about the steps:

1. The input tensor is 2D with shape [M, N], so each row has N elements.

2. For each row i (from 0 to M-1), compute the maximum of elements [i, 0], [i, 1], ..., [i, N-1].

3. The output tensor will be 1D with shape [M], where each element is the max of the corresponding row.

So, the kernel needs to process each row, and for each row, compute the max of N elements.

Now, how to structure the threads. Let's say each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. Then, for each row, the threads in the block would process that element, and then the block would compute the max of all the elements in the row.

But how to do that? For example, if the block has 128 threads, then each thread can take a single element in the row. But then, the block needs to compute the max of all the elements in the row. However, if the row has N elements, and the block size is 128, then for N elements, the number of blocks per row would be ceil(N / 128). But that's not efficient. Alternatively, maybe the block size is set to N, but that's not possible if N is large.

Alternatively, maybe each block is responsible for a single row. Then, the number of threads per block is N, but that's not feasible if N is large. But Triton allows for dynamic block sizes. Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written with a fixed block size, which is specified in the @triton.jit decorator.

So perhaps the approach is to have each block process a single row, and within the block, the threads compute the maximum of the elements in that row.

But how to do that? Let's think about the parameters. The kernel will take the input tensor, and output tensor. The input is [M, N], output is [M].

Okay, let's see. I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. So the input is a 2D tensor where each row is of length N, and I need to find the maximum value along each row. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says "max reduction along the last dimension". So for a tensor of shape [M, N], the last dimension is N. So for each row (each of the M rows), we take the maximum across the N elements. So the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the max of the corresponding row.

First, I need to think about how to structure the Triton kernel. Triton kernels are written in a way that's similar to CUDA kernels, using threads per block and blocks per grid. The key is to figure out how to process each row, and compute the maximum for each row.

So, the input is a 2D tensor, let's say input_tensor of shape [M, N]. The output is a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the max of the corresponding row.

Now, for each row, we need to compute the maximum. So, for each row i in 0..M-1, we need to look at elements input_tensor[i][j] for j in 0..N-1 and find the maximum.

In Triton, the kernel will be launched with a grid that covers all the rows. Each block will handle one row. So, the number of blocks would be M, and each block processes one row.

But wait, how to structure the threads. For each block, we can have multiple threads. For example, if we have a block size of 32, then each block would process a row, and the threads in the block would work together to compute the maximum.

But how to handle the threads in the block. For a row of N elements, the number of threads per block would need to be sufficient to process all elements. However, since N can vary, perhaps we need to use a dynamic approach. Alternatively, we can use a block size that is a power of two, and use a reduction approach within the block.

Wait, but for each row, the maximum can be computed using a reduction. So, for each row, we can have a thread per element, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, we can have a block that reduces the row into a single maximum value.

So, the approach would be:

- Each block is responsible for one row.
- The block processes the elements of that row, and computes the maximum.
- The maximum is stored in the output tensor.

But how to structure the threads in the block. Let's think about the block size. Let's say we have a block size of 32. For each row, the number of elements is N. So, if N is larger than the block size, then we need to do a reduction within the block. For example, if N is 1024, then each block can process 1024 elements, but with 32 threads, each thread would process 32 elements, and then reduce them.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, the maximum can be found by having each thread in the block process a chunk of elements, and then perform a reduction. But this requires that the block size is a power of two, and that the number of elements in the row is a multiple of the block size. However, since N can be arbitrary, we need to handle cases where N is not a multiple of the block size.

Alternatively, we can use a dynamic approach where each thread in the block is responsible for a certain range of elements, and then perform a reduction. But this might be complicated.

Alternatively, for each row, we can have a number of threads equal to the number of elements in the row, but that's not feasible if the row is very long. So, perhaps the best approach is to use a block size that is a power of two, and for each row, the threads in the block will process elements in the row, and then reduce them to find the maximum.

But how to handle the case where the number of elements in the row is not a multiple of the block size. For example, if the row has 10 elements and the block size is 32, then we need to have 10 threads in the block, but that's not a power of two. Hmm, but in Triton, the block size is fixed, so perhaps we need to choose a block size that is a power of two, and then use a reduction approach.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a block size that is a power of two, and for each row, the threads in the block will process elements in the row, and then perform a reduction

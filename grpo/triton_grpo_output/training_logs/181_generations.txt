Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that matrix multiplication involves computing the dot product of rows from the first matrix and columns from the second matrix. For efficient computation, especially on GPUs, using shared memory is crucial to reduce global memory access latency. So, I'll need to load chunks of data into shared memory and then perform the computation there.

The input tensors are A (M, K) and B (K, N). The output is C (M, N), where each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k. But since K can be large, we need to process this in tiles. So, the idea is to divide the matrices into blocks that fit into shared memory.

I should choose a block size that's a multiple of the thread count. Let's say each thread block processes a tile of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K) for matrix A and (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N) for matrix B. Wait, maybe I need to adjust the block sizes for the two matrices. Let me think: for matrix A (M, K), each thread block would handle a block of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K), and for matrix B (K, N), each thread block would handle (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N). But since the two matrices are multiplied, the tile size for A and B should be compatible.

Alternatively, maybe I should use a tile size that's compatible with both matrices. Let me check. For example, if I use a tile size of (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K) for A and (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N) for B, then each thread block would process a block of A and a block of B. But how does that fit into the matrix multiplication?

Wait, in matrix multiplication, each element of C is computed as the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, for each element in C, we need to compute the dot product of a row from A and a column from B. To do this efficiently, we can split the computation into tiles. For example, if we split A into tiles of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K), and B into tiles of size (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N), then each tile of A can be multiplied with a tile of B, and the result is stored in C.

But how to structure the threads. Let's think about the thread block. Each thread block would handle a block of A and a block of B. The threads within the block would compute the dot product between a row of A and a column of B. But how to organize the threads for that.

Alternatively, maybe each thread block handles a tile of A and a tile of B. For example, if the tile size is (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K) for A and (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N) for B, then each thread block would process a block of A and a block of B. But how to compute the dot product between these tiles.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread block process a block of A and a block of B, and each thread in the block computes a part of the result. For example, if the tile size is (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K) for A and (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N) for B, then each thread block would compute a block of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N) in the output matrix C.

But how to split the computation. Let's consider that each thread in the block is responsible for computing a particular element in the output matrix. However, that might not be efficient. Instead, perhaps each thread is responsible for computing a part of the dot product between a row of A and a column of B.

Alternatively, using a more efficient approach where each thread block processes a tile of A and a tile of B, and each thread computes a part of the dot product. For example, each thread in the block would compute a partial sum for a particular element in C. Let me think about the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton.

In the standard approach, each thread block processes a block of A and a block of B, and each thread in the block computes a part of the dot product. The threads are arranged in a grid where each thread block handles a block of A and B. The threads within the block are arranged in a way that each thread computes a part of the dot product. For example, if the block size is (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K) for A and (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N) for B, then each thread block would process a block of A and B, and the threads would compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B.

But perhaps I need to structure the threads such that each thread is responsible

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first matrix is MxK, the second is KxN, so the result should be MxN. But since we're using Triton, which is a GPU programming language, I need to think about how to efficiently compute this using shared memory and tiling.

Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for GPU parallelism. The key here is to use shared memory to reduce the number of global memory accesses, which is crucial for performance. So, the idea is to divide the matrices into tiles that fit into shared memory, compute the product in each tile, and then combine the results.

Let me recall the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton. Typically, each thread block handles a tile of the output matrix. For each element in the output matrix, the thread computes the dot product of the corresponding rows from the first matrix and columns from the second matrix. But with shared memory, we can load these tiles into shared memory and compute the dot product more efficiently.

So, the steps would be:

1. Determine the tile size. Let's say each tile is of size TILE_M x TILE_K for the first matrix and TILE_K x TILE_N for the second matrix. But since the matrices are MxK and KxN, the tile sizes need to be chosen such that they fit into shared memory. The shared memory size is limited, so the tile sizes must be small enough to fit in.

2. Each thread block will compute a block of the output matrix. The threads within the block will handle different elements of this block.

3. For each thread, we need to compute the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix. However, using shared memory, we can load the relevant tiles into shared memory, and then compute the dot product using the shared memory data.

Wait, but in the standard approach, the first matrix is stored in shared memory as rows, and the second matrix as columns. So, for each thread in the block, we compute the dot product of a row from the first matrix (loaded into shared memory) and a column from the second matrix (also loaded into shared memory). But how does this work with the tile sizes?

Alternatively, maybe each thread block handles a tile of the output matrix. For example, each block computes a submatrix of size TILE_M x TILE_N. To compute this, the block would need to load a tile of the first matrix (size TILE_M x TILE_K) and a tile of the second matrix (size TILE_K x TILE_N) into shared memory. Then, for each element in the output tile, the threads compute the dot product of the corresponding row from the first tile and column from the second tile.

But how to structure the threads? Let's think about the thread indices. Each thread in the block would be responsible for computing a specific element in the output tile. For example, if the output tile is of size TILE_M x TILE_N, then each thread would compute one element. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each thread block handles multiple elements in the output tile, but that's more complex.

Wait, in the standard approach, each thread block is responsible for computing a block of the output matrix. For example, if the output is MxN, and each block computes a TILE_M x TILE_N block, then the threads in the block are arranged in a way that each thread computes a specific element of that block.

But how to compute the dot product efficiently. Let me recall that in the standard matrix multiplication, each element in the output is the sum of the products of corresponding elements from the first matrix's row and the second matrix's column. So for each element (i,j) in the output, we compute sum_{k} A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But with shared memory, we can load the relevant tiles into shared memory. Let's say the first matrix is split into tiles of size TILE_M x TILE_K, and the second matrix into tiles of size TILE_K x TILE_N. Then, for each tile of the output, we need to compute the dot product of each row of the first tile and each column of the second tile.

But how to do this in Triton. Let's think about the kernel structure.

First, the kernel needs to handle the input matrices. The first matrix is of shape [M, K], and the second is [K, N]. The output is [M, N]. The kernel will process each element of the output matrix.

But with shared memory, the idea is to load a block of the first matrix into shared memory, and a block of the second matrix into shared memory. Then, for each element in

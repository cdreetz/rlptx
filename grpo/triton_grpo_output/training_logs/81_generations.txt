Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by understanding what's required here.

First, matrix multiplication between a matrix A (MxK) and matrix B (KxN) results in a matrix C (MxN). Each element C[i][j] is the sum of the products of elements from row i of A and column j of B. So, for each element in C, I need to compute the dot product of the corresponding row from A and column from B.

Now, thinking about how to implement this in Triton. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA. The kernel needs to handle the computation efficiently, using shared memory if possible to reduce global memory access latency.

Let me break down the steps:

1. **GPU Operations**: The main operation is the matrix multiplication, which involves multiple dot products. Each element of the output matrix is computed by multiplying elements from the corresponding row of A and column of B, then summing them up.

2. **Input/Output Shapes**: The input tensors are A (M x K) and B (K x N). The output tensor C will be M x N. So, the kernel needs to process each element of C by computing the dot product of A's row i and B's column j.

3. **Block Sizes and Memory Access**: Triton kernels are divided into blocks. For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to compute a single element of C. However, for efficiency, sometimes we use a block size that allows each thread to handle multiple elements. But given that K can be large, maybe using a block size that allows each thread to process a single element, but with shared memory to store the necessary parts of A and B.

Wait, but for matrix multiplication, a more efficient approach is to use shared memory to store slices of A and B. For example, each block can handle a portion of the matrix, and threads within the block can compute the dot product by accessing shared memory. However, since the problem here is to multiply two matrices, the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element of the result, but with shared memory for the rows of A and columns of B.

But in this case, the problem is to write a kernel that can handle this. Let me think about the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton.

In the standard approach, each thread computes one element of the output matrix. For that, each thread would need to access elements from the row of A and column of B. However, if K is large, this could lead to many memory accesses. To optimize, we can use shared memory to store a slice of A and B.

But given that the user hasn't specified any particular constraints, maybe the simplest approach is to have each thread compute one element of C, using global memory. However, that might not be efficient for large K. But perhaps for the sake of this problem, we can proceed with that approach, but with proper memory access patterns.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed to handle the multiplication in a way that each thread block handles a certain number of rows or columns. But I need to think about the parameters.

Let me think about the parameters. The kernel needs to take in the two input tensors A and B, and the output tensor C. The shapes are M x K and K x N. So, for each element C[i][j], we need to compute sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

In Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. So, the kernel would have a loop over i (rows of A) and j (columns of B), and for each i and j, compute the sum over k.

But how to structure the threads. Let me think about the thread indices. For example, each thread could be responsible for a particular (i, j) pair. But how to map this to the thread IDs.

Alternatively, the kernel could be structured with a loop over i and j, and each thread computes one element. However, for large K, this could be slow. So, perhaps using a block size that allows for more efficient computation.

But given that the user hasn't specified any particular constraints, maybe the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element, but with proper memory access.

But for that, the kernel would need to have the thread index for i and j. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The kernel would need to be called with the shapes of A, B, and C. But in Triton, the kernel is written with the parameters as inputs, and the kernel is called with the appropriate arguments.

But perhaps the kernel is written in a way that each thread computes one element of C. So, the kernel would have a loop over i and j, and for

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by understanding what's required here.

First, the operation is matrix multiplication. So, the first tensor is of shape (M, K), and the second is (K, N). The result should be a tensor of shape (M, N). Each element in the result is the sum of the products of elements from the rows of the first matrix and columns of the second matrix.

Now, thinking about how to implement this in Triton. Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for GPU parallelism. So, I need to structure the kernel to handle this efficiently.

Let me recall the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton. Typically, each thread block handles a block of rows and columns. For example, each thread block might handle a submatrix of the result. But since the matrices are of different dimensions, I need to make sure that the block sizes are chosen appropriately.

Wait, the problem here is that the first matrix is M x K, and the second is K x N. So, the multiplication is (M x K) * (K x N) = M x N. So, each element in the result is computed as the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j], where i is the row index in the result, j is the column index, and k is the index in the K dimension.

In Triton, each thread block can handle a certain number of rows and columns. But since K is the dimension that's being summed over, I need to make sure that the threads can access the K elements efficiently.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors are stored in row-major order, which is the standard for CUDA. So, for the first tensor A (M, K), each row is stored contiguously. Similarly for B (K, N), each row is stored contiguously.

So, for each element in the result matrix C[i][j], we need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

Now, the challenge is to partition this computation across threads. Let's consider using a block size that allows each thread to handle a certain number of elements in the K dimension. For example, if each thread block handles a certain number of rows (i) and columns (j), but since K is the dimension that's being summed over, perhaps we can split the K dimension into chunks that each thread can process.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a block size that allows each thread to handle a single element in the K dimension. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, we can use a block size that allows each thread to process multiple k's, but that depends on the block size.

Wait, in standard matrix multiplication, each thread block handles a block of rows and columns. For example, in a standard approach, each thread block handles a block of rows (i) and columns (j), and each thread within the block handles a single element in the K dimension. But that's not efficient if K is large. However, in this case, since K is the dimension being summed over, perhaps we can use a block size that allows each thread to process a certain number of k's.

But maybe I should think in terms of the standard approach. Let me recall that in Triton, for matrix multiplication, the kernel is often structured with each thread block handling a block of rows and columns. For example, each thread block handles a block of M rows and N columns. Then, each thread within the block handles a certain k. But that's for when the matrices are square. However, here the matrices are rectangular.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel can be structured such that each thread block handles a block of rows (i) and a block of columns (j), and each thread within the block handles a single k. But that would require that the block size is chosen such that the number of threads per block is sufficient to process all k's.

Alternatively, perhaps the block size is chosen as BLOCK_SIZE = 128, and each thread processes a single k. But that would require that the number of threads per block is sufficient to process the K dimension. Wait, but K can be up to, say, 1024, so if each thread handles a single k, then the number of threads per block would need to be at least K. But that's not feasible for large K. So that approach might not be efficient.

Wait, maybe I should think of the kernel as follows: each thread block handles a certain number of rows (i) and columns (j), and each thread within the block handles a certain number of k's. But how to structure that.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread block handles a single row of the first matrix (A) and a single column of the

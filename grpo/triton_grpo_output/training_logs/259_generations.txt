Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum each column of the 2D tensor. So for each column (which is along the N dimension), I need to add up all the elements in that column. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding column.

Next, input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor with dimensions M (rows) and N (columns). The output is a 1D tensor with M elements. The memory layout is probably row-major, so each row is stored contiguously. So for a tensor A with shape [M, N], the element at (i, j) is stored at position i*N + j. But in Triton, when we handle tensors, we need to consider how the data is accessed. For a 2D tensor, the strides would be (N, 1), so each row is N elements, and each column is 1 element.

Now, block sizes and memory access patterns. Since we're doing a sum over the last dimension (columns), each thread should handle one column. But since threads can't directly access all elements of a column, we need to figure out how to partition the work. Let's think about how many threads per block. If we have N columns, and each thread is responsible for a single column, then the number of threads per block would depend on how many columns can fit into a block. But since the number of columns can be large, maybe we should use a block size that's a multiple of the number of columns. Alternatively, maybe we can process multiple columns per thread, but that might complicate things. Wait, no. Since each column is independent, each thread can handle one column. So the number of threads per block would be the number of columns, but that's not efficient if N is large. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread handle a single element in a column, but that would require multiple threads per column. Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to have each thread handle a single column, but that would require that the number of threads per block is equal to the number of columns. But that's not feasible for large N. So maybe we need to process multiple elements per thread, but that's not straightforward. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think again.

The sum is over the last dimension (columns), so for each column j, we need to sum all elements in that column. So for each column j, the elements are A[0, j], A[1, j], ..., A[M-1, j]. So each column has M elements. So for each column j, we need to sum M elements. So each thread can be responsible for a single column j, and then sum all the elements in that column. But how to do that efficiently.

In Triton, each thread is responsible for a single element. Wait, no. Wait, the kernel is designed to process elements in a way that each thread can handle a subset of the data. So for the sum reduction, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element in the column, and then accumulate the sum. But that would require that each thread is assigned to a particular element in the column. Alternatively, perhaps we can have each thread process a single column and sum all its elements. But how to do that.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a grid of threads where each thread is responsible for a single column. So the number of threads in the grid would be N (number of columns). Each thread would process the elements in its column. But how to do that. For example, if we have a column j, then each thread in the block would process that column. But how to access the elements in that column. For each column j, the elements are at positions (i, j) for i from 0 to M-1. So the linear index for element (i, j) is i*N + j. So for a given j, the elements are at positions j, j + N, j + 2*N, etc. So for a given j, the elements are spaced N apart in the linear index.

So if each thread is responsible for a single column j, then for that column, the thread needs to sum all the elements. So the thread would iterate over i from 0 to M-1, and add A[i*N + j]. But that would require that the thread does M operations, which is not efficient. So that's not feasible for large M. So that approach would be O(M) per thread, which is not efficient. So that's not a good way.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a block size that allows each thread to process

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is to sum over the columns (since the last dimension is N). So for each row in the tensor, we need to add up all the elements in that row. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding row.

Now, considering Triton's capabilities. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA, but with more flexibility. The kernel will process elements in blocks, and each thread will handle a portion of the data.

Let me think about the input and output. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output is a 1D tensor of shape [M]. Each element in the output is the sum of the elements in the corresponding row of the input.

For the kernel, I need to decide on the block size. Typically, for reduction operations, a block size of 1024 is common, but since we're summing over N elements per row, maybe a block size that can handle multiple elements per thread. Wait, but each thread can process one element in the row. Wait, no. Wait, for each row, each thread can handle one element. But since each row has N elements, and there are M rows, the total number of elements is M*N. But the output is M elements.

Wait, but for each row, we need to sum all N elements. So for each row, we need to add up N elements. So for each row, the threads in the block can process the elements in that row. But how to organize that.

Alternatively, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element in the input tensor. Then, for each row, all threads in the block would process the elements in that row. But since each row has N elements, and the block size is, say, 1024, then each block can process up to 1024 elements. But since each row has N elements, if N is larger than the block size, then multiple blocks would be needed for each row. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed to process each row in a way that each thread handles a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction across the threads in the block to sum the row.

Wait, but for each row, the sum is the sum of all elements in that row. So for each row, we can have multiple threads working on that row, each contributing their element to the sum. Then, the threads in the block can perform a reduction to compute the sum for that row.

So the steps would be:

1. Each thread is responsible for a single element in the input tensor. But how to map threads to elements.

But the input is a 2D tensor, so perhaps the threads are arranged in a way that each thread handles a particular element in the row. For example, if the row index is i, and the column index is j, then each thread could be assigned a (i, j) pair.

But how to organize this in Triton. Let's think about the kernel parameters. The input tensor is a 2D tensor, so we can pass it as a pointer, and the kernel will access it with indices.

But for the kernel, we need to know the number of rows M and columns N. So the kernel will need to be given M and N as parameters. Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is called with the input tensor and the output tensor, and the dimensions. So perhaps the kernel is called with the input tensor, output tensor, M, N.

But in the kernel, each thread will process a particular element in the input tensor. For example, for each row i, and column j, the thread will process the element at (i, j). But how to map the threads to these indices.

Alternatively, since we need to sum over the columns, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element in a row, and then the threads in the block perform a reduction to sum the elements of that row.

But how to handle this. Let me think about the block structure. For each row, the threads in the block can process the elements in that row. For example, if the block size is 1024, and the row has N elements, then each block can process up to 1024 elements. But if N is larger than the block size, then multiple blocks would be needed for each row. But that's not efficient. Alternatively, perhaps each block is responsible for a single row, and the threads in the block process the elements of that row.

But that would require that the number of blocks is equal to M, and each block processes

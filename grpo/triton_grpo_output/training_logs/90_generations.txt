Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to compute the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. So for each row (each M element), I need to sum all the elements in that row and then divide by N. But since Triton is a GPU programming language, I need to structure this in a way that's efficient on the GPU.

The input tensor is 2D with shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

Now, considering the memory layout. The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. For each row, I need to process all N elements. The output will be one value per row.

Next, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels typically use a grid of blocks, each processing a portion of the data. For this problem, each block can handle a single row. But since each row has N elements, I need to decide how many elements each thread processes. If I have a block size of, say, 256 threads, each thread could process a single element in the row. But maybe it's better to have each thread handle a single element, so that each thread can accumulate the sum for its row.

Wait, but if each thread is responsible for one element in the row, then each row would have N threads processing it. But since each row is of length N, and the block size is 256, maybe each block can handle a row if N is less than 256. But if N is larger than 256, then multiple blocks would be needed. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread process a single element, and each block processes a single row. But that would require that each row is processed by a block, and each thread in the block processes one element. But that might not be efficient if N is large.

Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread process a single element, and each block processes a single row. So for each row, the threads in the block process each element in the row. But how to organize that.

Wait, perhaps the kernel should process each row. So for each row, we need to sum all elements. So the kernel can be structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element in a row. Then, for each row, all threads in the block process that row's elements. But how to manage that.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each block processes a single row. Each thread in the block processes a single element in that row. But that would require that each block is assigned a row, and then each thread in the block handles one element of that row. However, this would require that the number of threads per block is equal to the number of elements in the row. But that's not possible if the row has varying lengths. Wait, but in this case, all rows have the same length N. So for each row, we can have N threads in a block. But if N is large, say 1024, then each block would have 1024 threads, which is possible but may not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe the block size is fixed, and each thread handles a single element, and the block processes a single row. But that would require that the number of threads per block is equal to N. However, if N is larger than the block size, this might not be feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured with each thread processing a single element in the row, and each block processes a single row. So for each row, the threads in the block process each element. But how to assign the rows to blocks. The grid is determined by the number of rows, M. Each block processes one row. Then, for each row, the threads in the block process each element in that row. So the block size would be N, but that's not possible if N is larger than the maximum block size. So maybe the block size is fixed, and each block processes a single row. For example, if the block size is 256, then for each row, we can have up to 256 threads processing elements of that row. But if N is larger than 256, then multiple blocks would be needed per row. Wait, but that's not possible. So maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread processes a single element, and the block processes a single row. So for each row, the threads in the block process all elements of that row. But how to handle that.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and the block processes a single row

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations required. The task is to compute the mean along the last dimension, which means for each row (since the last dimension is N), we need to sum all elements and then divide by N. So, for each row in the tensor, sum the elements and then divide by N.

Next, input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

Now, considering the block sizes and memory access patterns. Triton kernels typically use a grid of blocks, each processing a portion of the data. Since we're dealing with rows, each block can handle a row. But since each row has N elements, we need to process each element in the row. However, since we're computing the sum, each block can process a row, and each thread can handle a single element in that row. Wait, but if we have multiple threads per block, maybe each thread can handle one element. But for a row of N elements, the number of threads per block would be N, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can process each row in a block, with each thread handling one element. But how to structure this.

Wait, maybe the block size should be such that each block processes one row. So, each block is responsible for a single row. Then, each thread in the block processes one element in that row. But for a row of N elements, if we have, say, 32 threads per block, then each block can process 32 elements. But if N is not a multiple of 32, that's a problem. Alternatively, maybe the block size is set to 32, and each thread processes one element in the row. Then, for each row, the threads in the block will sum the elements. But how to handle that.

Alternatively, maybe each thread processes a single element in the row, and the block computes the sum of the elements in the row. Then, each block is responsible for a single row. But how to determine which row each block is responsible for. That would require the block index to be mapped to the row index. So, the grid is determined by the number of rows, M, and each block processes one row.

So, the kernel would have a grid of M blocks, each block processing one row. Each block has, say, 32 threads. Each thread in the block processes one element in the row. Then, the block sums all the elements in the row, and then divides by N to get the mean.

But how to handle the thread indices. For each block, the row index is determined by the block index. Then, within the block, each thread index corresponds to the column index in the row. So, for a row i, each thread j in the block processes column j. Then, the sum is computed by adding all the elements in the row.

But wait, if the row has N elements, and the block has 32 threads, then for N < 32, some threads would be out of bounds. So, we need to handle that with masking. So, each thread in the block checks if its column index is within the row's N elements. If not, it contributes 0 to the sum.

So, the steps would be:

1. Determine the row index for each block. For the grid, each block is responsible for a row. So, the grid is M blocks. Each block's row index is the block index.

2. For each thread in the block, compute the column index as the thread index. Then, check if the column index is less than N. If yes, load the value from the input tensor, else 0.

3. Sum all the values for the row, then divide by N to get the mean.

But how to handle the division by N. Since N is the number of elements in the row, but if N is zero, but in this case, the input tensor is [M, N], so N is the second dimension. So, assuming N is at least 1.

But in the kernel, we need to handle the case where N is zero? Well, the problem states that the input is [M, N], so N is the number of columns. So, in the kernel, we need to know N. So, the kernel must take N as a parameter, or it can be passed as a parameter.

Wait, the kernel needs to know the shape of the input tensor. So, in Triton, the kernel can take parameters like the input tensor, the output tensor, the dimensions M and N, and the stride of the

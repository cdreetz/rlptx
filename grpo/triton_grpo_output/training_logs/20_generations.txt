Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the minimum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor). So for each row (each M element), I need to find the minimum of the N elements in that row.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Since we're dealing with rows, each threadblock should handle one row. So, the number of threadblocks should be M. Each threadblock will process one row. The number of threads per block would depend on N. If N is large, we need enough threads to process each element in the row. Let's say we use a block size of 128, but that might not be optimal. Wait, maybe the block size should be determined based on N. Alternatively, we can use a dynamic block size. But for simplicity, perhaps we can set a fixed block size, say 128, and let the threads process elements in the row.

Wait, but for each row, the number of elements is N. So, each threadblock should process N elements. But if N is not a multiple of the block size, we need to handle that. Alternatively, maybe each threadblock handles a single row, and each thread within the block processes a single element in that row. Wait, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can have each threadblock process a single row, and each thread in the block processes a single element in that row. But that would require that the number of threads per block is equal to N. However, if N is large, that might not be efficient. So perhaps we should use a block size that's a multiple of N, but that depends on N. Alternatively, we can use a fixed block size, and for each row, the threads process the elements in the row in a way that's efficient.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to have each threadblock handle one row. Then, each thread in the block is responsible for a single element in that row. But that would require that the number of threads per block is equal to N. But if N is large, that's not feasible. So maybe we need to use a block size that's a multiple of N. But since N can vary, perhaps we need to use a dynamic approach. Alternatively, perhaps the block size is set to a value that allows for efficient processing, and then we handle the elements in the row with a loop over the elements.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a block size that's 128, and for each row, the threads process the elements in the row in a way that's efficient. For example, each thread processes a single element, and the block processes all elements in the row. But that would require that the number of threads per block is equal to N. However, if N is not a multiple of the block size, then we need to handle that with some masking.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured so that each threadblock handles one row, and each thread in the block processes a single element in that row. So for a row with N elements, the number of threads per block is N. But since N can be large, this might not be efficient. However, Triton allows for dynamic block sizes, so perhaps we can compute the number of threads per block based on N. But for the purposes of this problem, maybe we can assume that N is manageable with a fixed block size.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is designed such that each threadblock processes a single row, and the threads within the block process the elements in the row in a way that's efficient. For example, each thread in the block processes a single element, and the block's threads work together to compute the minimum.

Wait, but how to compute the minimum. For each row, we need to find the minimum of all elements. So, for a row, we can have multiple threads processing different elements, and then the threads collaborate to find the minimum.

But for this, perhaps the kernel can be structured as follows: each threadblock processes one row. The threads within the block are responsible for a subset of the elements in the row. Then, they compute the minimum of their subset and combine the results.

But how to structure this. For example, using a reduction approach. For each row, the threads in the block can work in a reduction pattern to find the minimum.

Alternatively, since the row is processed in parallel, each thread can take an element and compare it with the current minimum. But that would require that each thread has

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the minimum value in each row of a 2D tensor. Since the tensor is [M, N], each row has N elements, and we need to compute the min for each of the M rows.

So, the input is a 2D tensor, and the output is a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Now, considering how Triton works, I need to structure the kernel to process each row. Each thread will handle one row. But wait, how many threads per row? Let's think about the block size. Since each row has N elements, and each thread can process one element, maybe each thread handles one element in the row. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can have multiple threads per row, but since we need to find the minimum, perhaps each thread can take care of a portion of the row.

Wait, but for a reduction, the standard approach is to have each thread process a part of the data and then combine results. However, in this case, since we're reducing along the last dimension (each row), each thread can be responsible for a single element in the row, and then we need to find the minimum among all elements in the row.

But how to do that in Triton? Let's think about the kernel structure.

Each thread will process a row. Let's say each thread is responsible for a single row. Wait, but if there are M rows, and each thread can handle one row, then we need to have M threads. But in Triton, the number of threads is determined by the block size. So, perhaps we can have each block process one row, and each block has multiple threads. But maybe that's not the most efficient way.

Alternatively, each thread can process a single element in the row, and then the threads in the block combine their results. But for that, the block needs to be able to reduce the elements in the row.

Wait, maybe the approach is to have each thread handle a single element in the row, and then the block reduces those elements to find the minimum for the row. But how to structure that.

Let me think. For a given row, there are N elements. Each thread in the block can be responsible for a certain range of elements. But since we need to find the minimum, perhaps the block can perform a reduction over the elements of the row.

But how to map the threads to the elements. Let's think of the block size as BLOCK_SIZE. For each row, the block will process all elements in that row. But how to split the elements among threads.

Alternatively, each thread can be responsible for a single element in the row, and then the block reduces those elements. For example, if the block has 128 threads, then each thread can process one element. But if the row has more than 128 elements, then we need multiple blocks. But that's okay.

But how to handle the case where the row has a different number of elements. For example, if N is not a multiple of the block size. But in Triton, the kernel is written to handle any N, so the code should handle that.

So, the steps would be:

1. For each row in the input tensor, compute the minimum of all elements in that row.

2. The output tensor will have M elements, each being the minimum of the corresponding row.

Now, the kernel needs to process each row. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The input is a 2D tensor, say input_tensor of shape [M, N]. The output is a 1D tensor of shape [M].

In Triton, the kernel will be written with the @triton.jit decorator. The kernel needs to process each row. So, for each row, the kernel will iterate through all elements in that row and find the minimum.

But how to structure the threads. Let's consider that each thread is responsible for a single row. Wait, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, each block can process a single row. Let's think of the block size as BLOCK_SIZE. For each row, the block will process all elements in that row. But how to split the elements among threads.

Alternatively, each thread can process a single element in the row. Then, the block can reduce the elements to find the minimum.

But for that, the kernel needs to have a way to iterate over the elements of the row. Let's think about the indices.

Let me think of the kernel parameters. The kernel will take the input tensor, the output tensor, the dimensions M and N. Then, for each row i, the kernel will process all elements in that row.

But how

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the min reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the minimum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor). So for each row (each M element), I need to find the minimum of the N elements in that row.

Now, considering how Triton works, I need to structure the kernel to process each row. The kernel will run in parallel across different rows, so each thread should handle one row. But wait, how do I split the work? Since the tensor is 2D, each thread can be responsible for a single row. But how many threads per block? Let's think about block size. Maybe using a block size that can handle multiple rows, but since each row is independent, maybe each thread handles one row. Wait, but if the number of rows (M) is large, maybe we need to have multiple threads per block. But for simplicity, perhaps each thread handles one row. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each block handles a certain number of rows. But for a min reduction, each row is independent, so each thread can process one row.

Wait, but in Triton, threads are grouped into blocks. So maybe each block processes a single row. But how to split the rows across blocks? Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The input tensor is [M, N], and the output is [M], since each row's min is computed.

So the kernel needs to process each row. Let's say each thread is responsible for a single row. Then, the number of threads per block would be equal to the number of rows (M) divided by the number of blocks. But that depends on the grid size. Alternatively, maybe each thread is assigned a row index. So the kernel is launched with a grid size that covers all rows. For example, if there are M rows, the grid size is (M, 1), and each thread in the block processes one row.

But how to structure this. Let me think about the parameters. The kernel will take the input tensor, and output tensor. The input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N], and the output is a 1D tensor with shape [M], where each element is the min of the corresponding row.

So, the kernel's logic would be:

For each row i in 0 to M-1:
   Find the minimum value in the row i (elements from 0 to N-1 in that row)

Now, in Triton, each thread is responsible for a specific row. So the thread index (thread_idx) would correspond to the row index. But how to handle that. Let me think about the kernel's parameters. The kernel will be launched with a grid size of (M, 1), and each thread in the block processes one row. But wait, in Triton, the grid is specified as (num_blocks_x, num_blocks_y), and each block has a certain number of threads. So, if I have M rows, then the grid size would be (M, 1), but that would be a lot of blocks. Alternatively, maybe the grid is (1, 1), and the block processes all rows. But that's not efficient. So perhaps the block size is set to 1, and each thread handles one row. But that's not efficient either. Wait, but if the number of rows is large, then the number of threads would be M, which could be large. However, Triton can handle that.

Alternatively, maybe each block processes multiple rows. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block handles 128 rows. But that depends on the value of M. However, for the purpose of this problem, perhaps it's easier to have each thread handle one row. So the grid size is (M, 1), and each thread is responsible for one row.

But how to compute the row index. Let's say the kernel is launched with a grid of (M, 1), and each thread in the block is assigned a row index. Wait, no. In Triton, the grid is (num_blocks_x, num_blocks_y), and each block has a certain number of threads. So, for example, if we have a grid of (M, 1), then each block is responsible for a single row. But that would require that each block has exactly one thread. But that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is written such that each thread is responsible for a row. So, the thread index (thread_idx) is the row index. So, the kernel's code would look like:

@triton.jit
def kernel(input, output, N, M, ...):
    row_idx = tl.arange

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the min reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the minimum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor). So for each row (each M element), I need to find the minimum of the N elements in that row.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Now, considering the memory layout. The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. For each row, the elements are stored consecutively. So for row i, the elements are at positions i*N to i*N + N - 1.

Optimal block sizes and memory access patterns. Since each row has N elements, and we need to process all elements in a row, the block size should be chosen such that each thread processes a portion of the row. However, since we need to find the minimum, it's more efficient to have each thread handle a single element and compare with the current minimum. But since the number of elements per row can vary, maybe using a block size that allows for efficient parallelism.

Wait, but for a reduction, a common approach is to have each thread handle a portion of the data, and then combine results. However, since each row is independent, maybe we can process each row in parallel. So, for each row, we can have multiple threads processing the elements in that row, and then compute the minimum.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The kernel will take the input tensor, the output tensor, the dimensions M and N. The kernel will process each row (i) and compute the min for that row.

So, the kernel will have a loop over the rows (i), and for each row, process all elements in that row. But in Triton, the kernel is written with a grid and a block structure. So, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single row. Wait, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, each thread could process a single element in the row, but that would require more threads.

Alternatively, for each row, we can have multiple threads working on that row. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block can process a row, and each thread in the block handles a portion of the row's elements. But how to handle the reduction within the block.

Wait, maybe the approach is to have each thread process a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction within the block. For example, for a row with N elements, each thread in the block handles a chunk of elements, and then the block reduces the minimum of those chunks. But that might be complicated.

Alternatively, for each row, the kernel can process all elements in that row, and each thread handles one element. Then, the threads in the block can compute the minimum of their elements and combine them. However, this would require that each block processes a single row. But how to structure this.

Alternatively, since the rows are independent, we can have each thread handle a single row. For example, if there are M rows, then each thread is assigned to a row. Then, for each row, the thread needs to compute the minimum of all N elements in that row. But how to do that efficiently.

But for each row, the thread would need to iterate over all N elements, which could be inefficient if N is large. However, since we're using Triton, which is a GPU programming language, we can use the triton's loop constructs to process each element in the row.

So, the kernel would have a grid of M threads, each handling one row. For each row, the thread would iterate over all N elements, and compute the minimum. But that's not efficient, because for each row, the thread would have to loop through N elements, which could be slow for large N.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a more efficient approach by using a reduction within the block. For example, each block processes a single row, and within the block, the threads perform a reduction to find the minimum. This would be more efficient because the reduction is done in parallel within the block.

So, for each row, we can have a block of threads that process the elements of that row. The block size is chosen such that each block can process a row. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block handles a row, and the threads in the block work together to find the minimum of the row.

But how to assign the rows to the blocks. The grid size would be

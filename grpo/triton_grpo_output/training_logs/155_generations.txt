Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in Triton.

First, the input tensors are A (M x K) and B (K x N). The result is a matrix C (M x N) where each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k. 

Since we're using tile-based computation, I should think about how to partition the matrices into tiles that fit into shared memory. The standard approach is to use a block size that allows for efficient memory access. For example, a common block size is 32x32, but I need to adjust based on the problem.

In Triton, each kernel launch is divided into warps, and each warp processes a block of elements. For matrix multiplication, each thread typically handles a single element of the result matrix. However, with shared memory, we can load tiles of A and B into shared memory and compute the dot product for each tile.

So, the steps would be:

1. Determine the block size. Let's say each thread block processes a tile of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K) for matrix A and (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N) for matrix B. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of how many elements each thread handles. Alternatively, each thread might compute a single element of C, but with shared memory, we can load rows of A and columns of B into shared memory.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element of C. But with shared memory, we can load a block of A's rows and B's columns. Let me think again.

In matrix multiplication, each thread can compute a single element of C. For that, each thread needs to access a row of A and a column of B. However, if the matrices are large, this would be inefficient. So, using shared memory, we can load a tile of A (say, a block of rows) and a tile of B (a block of columns) into shared memory, then compute the dot product for each tile.

But the exact tile sizes depend on the block size. For example, if each thread block is responsible for a block of M rows and N columns in the result matrix, then the tile size for A would be BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K, and for B, BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N. Wait, maybe I should use a block size that allows for efficient computation.

Alternatively, for each thread, we can compute a single element of C. So, each thread is responsible for a particular (i, j) in the result matrix. Then, for that (i, j), the thread needs to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But to do this efficiently, we can load the row i of A into shared memory and the column j of B into shared memory. However, if the matrices are large, this would require multiple threads to load different rows and columns, which might not be efficient.

Alternatively, using a tile-based approach where each thread block handles a tile of A and B. For example, if the block size is 32x32, then each thread block processes a tile of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K) for A and (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N) for B. Then, the threads in the block compute the dot product between the tiles of A and B.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let me think about the parameters.

The kernel will take the input tensors A and B, and output tensor C. The kernel will be launched with grid dimensions that cover the entire M x N matrix.

Each thread in the kernel will compute a single element of C. So, the thread index can be determined by the thread's position in the grid. For example, the thread index (i, j) in the grid corresponds to the element C[i][j].

But to compute C[i][j], the thread needs to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. However, if the matrices are large, this would require multiple accesses to A and B, which could be slow if not done properly.

To optimize, we can load the row i of A into shared memory and the column j of B into shared memory. But if the matrices are large, this would require each thread to load a row and column, which might not be efficient. Alternatively, using a block size that allows for more efficient computation.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to use a block size of 32x32, and each thread computes a single element of C. Then, the shared memory is used to store the row of A and the column of B. But if the matrices are large, this would require multiple threads to

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in Triton.

First, the matrices are A (MxK) and B (KxN). The result C should be (MxN), where each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k. But with tile-based computation, I need to break this down into smaller tiles to optimize memory access and use shared memory efficiently.

So, the kernel will process each tile of A and B, compute the dot product of the tiles, and store the result in C. The key is to use shared memory for the tiles to reduce global memory access latency.

Let me think about the steps:

1. **Memory Layout and Shapes**: The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. The output C is also in row-major. For each block, we'll load a tile of A and B into shared memory. The tile size is usually a power of two, like 32x32. But I need to decide the block size. Let's say each tile is of size TILE_M x TILE_K for A and TILE_K x TILE_N for B. Wait, but the actual tile size depends on how we split the matrices. Maybe the tile size is determined by the block size. For example, each block processes a certain number of rows and columns.

2. **Shared Memory**: Each thread block will load a tile of A and B into shared memory. The shared memory for A will be of size (TILE_M x TILE_K), and for B it's (TILE_K x TILE_N). But since the matrices are stored in row-major, the shared memory layout needs to be contiguous. So for A, each row is stored contiguously, and for B, each column is stored contiguously.

3. **Thread Assignment**: Each thread in the block will handle a specific element in the tile. For example, if the block is responsible for rows i to i+TILE_M-1 of A and columns j to j+TILE_N-1 of C, then each thread will compute a part of the dot product.

Wait, maybe I should structure the kernel such that each thread block handles a block of rows in A and a block of columns in B. But I need to think about how the threads are arranged. Typically, in matrix multiplication, each thread block handles a tile of A and a tile of B. The threads within the block compute the dot product between the corresponding rows of A and columns of B.

But how to split the problem into tiles. Let me think of the block size. Let's say each thread block is responsible for processing a tile of A (size TILE_M x TILE_K) and a tile of B (size TILE_K x TILE_N). Then, the number of threads per block would be TILE_M * TILE_K, but that might be too large. Alternatively, perhaps the block size is TILE_M x TILE_K, with each thread handling a specific element in the tile.

Wait, maybe I should use a block size of TILE_M x TILE_K, where each thread is responsible for a specific element in the tile. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, the block size is TILE_M x TILE_K, and each thread computes a part of the dot product.

Alternatively, the block size is TILE_M x TILE_K, and each thread is responsible for a specific element in the tile. For example, each thread computes a single element of the result matrix. But that's not efficient because each element requires a dot product over K elements.

Hmm, maybe I need to use a more efficient approach. Let me recall that in matrix multiplication, each thread block can compute a block of the result matrix. For example, each thread block handles a block of rows in A and a block of columns in B. The threads within the block compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B.

Wait, perhaps the block size is TILE_M x TILE_K, and each thread is responsible for a specific element in the tile. But that's not right. Let me think again.

The standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to have each thread block compute a block of the result matrix. For example, if the block is responsible for rows i to i+TILE_M-1 of A and columns j to j+TILE_N-1 of C, then each thread in the block computes a part of the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B.

But how to structure this. Let me think of the kernel as follows:

Each thread block is responsible for a block of rows in A (size TILE_M) and a block of columns in B (size TILE_K). Wait, no. The matrices are A (M

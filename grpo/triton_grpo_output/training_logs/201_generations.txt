Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, the input is a 2D tensor with dimensions M (rows) and N (columns). The task is to compute the maximum value along the last dimension, which means for each row, I need to find the maximum of all elements in that row. So the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the maximum of the corresponding row in the input.

Now, thinking about how to implement this in Triton. Triton kernels are written in a way that's similar to CUDA kernels, using threads and blocks. The key is to figure out how to process each row efficiently.

Let me think about the data layout. The input tensor is [M, N], so each row has N elements. For each row, we need to compute the maximum. So, each thread should handle a single row, right? Or maybe multiple threads can work on a single row, but since we need the maximum, it's better to have each thread process a part of the row and then combine the results.

Wait, but in Triton, the threads are organized into blocks. So, perhaps each block handles a single row. But since N can be large, maybe each block processes a portion of the row. However, since the maximum is a reduction operation, it's better to have each thread process a part of the row and then combine the results.

Alternatively, for each row, we can have multiple threads working on different elements of the row, and then perform a reduction among them. But how to structure this.

Let me think about the steps:

1. For each row in the input tensor, compute the maximum value.
2. The output tensor will have one element per row.

So, the kernel needs to process each row independently. Let's consider that each thread is responsible for processing a single row. But if the number of threads per block is not enough, we might need to have multiple threads per row.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is divided into blocks, and each block can have multiple threads. So, perhaps the approach is to have each block handle a single row. For example, if the number of rows is M, then each block processes one row. But if M is large, then the number of blocks would be M. However, in Triton, the number of blocks is determined by the number of threads per block. So, maybe the kernel is designed such that each block processes a single row, and each thread in the block processes a part of the row.

Alternatively, perhaps each block processes a single row, and the threads in the block work together to compute the maximum for that row. For example, if the block has BLOCK_SIZE threads, then each thread can take a portion of the row's elements and compute the maximum among them, then combine the results.

But how to structure this. Let's think about the parameters. The input tensor is [M, N], and the output is [M]. So, for each row i, we need to find the max of input[i, 0...N-1].

So, for each row, the threads in the block can process the elements of that row. Let's assume that each block handles a single row. Then, the number of blocks would be M, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, if we have multiple threads per row, then each block can process a row, and each thread in the block handles a part of the row.

But perhaps a better approach is to have each block process a single row, and each thread in the block is responsible for a single element in the row. Then, the threads in the block can perform a reduction to find the maximum. But that would require that the number of threads per block is sufficient to process all elements in the row.

Wait, but for a row with N elements, if each thread in the block processes one element, then the block needs to have at least N threads. However, if N is large, that's not efficient. So, maybe we need to use a reduction approach where each thread processes a subset of elements and then combines the results.

Alternatively, for each row, we can have multiple threads working on different elements and then combining the maximum. For example, using a standard reduction pattern where threads split the elements into chunks and combine their results.

So, the steps for a row would be:

- Initialize the max value as the first element.
- For each subsequent element, compare and update the max.
- But this is a simple sequential approach, which might not be efficient in parallel. However, in Triton, using a reduction approach where threads work in parallel to compute the max.

So, perhaps the kernel is structured as follows:

Each thread is responsible for a certain range of elements in the row. Then, they compute the max of

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the maximum value in that row). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the max of N elements.

Now, considering how Triton works, the kernel will process elements in blocks. The key is to determine the block size and how to handle the data efficiently.

Let me recall that Triton kernels use a grid of blocks, each processing a certain number of elements. For a 2D tensor, each block might handle a row. But since we're doing a reduction, each block needs to process multiple elements in a row.

Wait, for a max reduction along the last dimension (N), each row has N elements. So for each row, we need to find the maximum of N elements. The standard approach for reduction is to use a parallel reduction, where each block processes a portion of the data and combines the results.

But since the tensor is 2D, each row is of length N. So each block can handle a row, and then perform a reduction across the elements in that row. Alternatively, maybe the blocks can process multiple elements in a row, but that depends on the block size.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensor is [M, N], so each row is N elements. The output will be a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the max of the corresponding row.

So, the kernel needs to process each row, compute the max of its elements, and store the result in the output tensor.

Now, for the Triton kernel, I need to decide on the block size. Let's say each block handles a row. But since each row has N elements, and we need to compute the max, the block size should be such that it can process the elements in the row. However, if N is large, a single block might not be able to process all elements in a row. So, perhaps the block size is set to a value that allows for a parallel reduction within the block.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, the maximum can be found by a parallel reduction. So each block can process a subset of the elements in the row, and then combine the results.

Alternatively, maybe the block size is set to a value that allows each block to process a certain number of elements in the row. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block can process 128 elements in a row, but that depends on how the data is laid out.

But perhaps the standard approach is to have each block process a row, and then perform a reduction across the elements in that row. However, for that, the block needs to process all elements in the row. But if the row is longer than the block size, that might not be efficient.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed to process each row in a way that allows for a parallel reduction. Let me think about the steps:

For each row (i.e., each row index M), we need to compute the max of the elements in that row. So, the kernel needs to iterate over each row, and for each row, compute the max of its elements.

But how to do that in Triton. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The input tensor is a 2D tensor, and the output is a 1D tensor of size M.

The kernel will have to process each row. So, the first thing is to determine which rows are processed by each block. But since the rows are independent, each block can handle a single row. However, that's not efficient if the row has many elements. So perhaps the block is responsible for processing a row, and then performing a reduction across the elements in that row.

But how to structure this. Let's think of the kernel as processing each row, and for each row, compute the max.

Let me outline the steps:

1. For each row i in 0 to M-1:
   a. For each element in the row (columns 0 to N-1), find the maximum.

But in Triton, the kernel is written in a way that each thread processes a part of the data. So, perhaps each thread is responsible for a certain element in the row, and then the threads in the block combine their results.

But for a row of N elements, the maximum can be computed using a parallel reduction. So, the block would process all elements in the row, and the threads in the block would perform the reduction.

But how to structure that. Let's say that the block size is set to a value that allows for a reduction. For example, if the block size is 12

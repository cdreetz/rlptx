Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to compute the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. So for each row (each M element), I need to sum all the N elements and then divide by N. But since Triton is a low-level framework, I have to handle this with threads and memory accesses efficiently.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row. So each row in the input contributes one element to the output.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels typically use a grid of blocks, each processing a certain number of rows. Let's decide on a block size. Since each thread can handle one row, maybe each thread processes one row. But wait, if each thread processes one row, then the number of threads per block would be M, but that's not efficient. Wait, no, the number of threads per block depends on the block size. Let me think: for a 2D tensor, each row has N elements. So for each row, the thread needs to sum all N elements. So maybe each thread is responsible for a single row, and the block size is determined by how many rows can be processed in parallel. But if the rows are independent, maybe each thread can handle one row. However, for large N, this might not be efficient. Wait, but the sum for each row is a reduction over the N elements. So maybe each thread is responsible for a subset of the elements in a row. Hmm, perhaps I should structure the kernel such that each thread processes a single row, and then accumulates the sum for that row.

Wait, but for each row, the sum is over N elements. So for each row, the thread needs to read all N elements and sum them. But if each thread is responsible for a single row, then each thread would need to process N elements. However, if the block size is large enough, maybe we can have multiple threads per block, each handling a different row. But for a 2D tensor, the rows are M in number. So the number of threads per block would be M / (number of blocks). Wait, perhaps it's better to have each thread process a single row. So each thread is responsible for one row, and the block size is determined by the number of rows. But if M is large, then the number of blocks would be M / BLOCK_SIZE. But how to handle this in Triton.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread processes a single row, and for each row, the thread sums all the elements in that row. But for that, each thread would need to read N elements. However, for a 2D tensor, the memory layout is [M, N], so each row is contiguous in memory. So for a given row i, the elements are at positions i*N, i*N+1, ..., i*N + N-1.

But in Triton, each thread can process a single row. So the kernel would have a grid of blocks, each block processing a certain number of rows. Wait, but if each thread is responsible for a single row, then the number of threads per block would be determined by the block size. For example, if the block size is 1024, then each block can process 1024 rows. But that's only if the number of rows is large enough. However, for a 2D tensor, the rows are M in number, so the grid would be (M + BLOCK_SIZE - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE blocks. But perhaps that's not the right way to structure it.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. Wait, no, that's not helpful. Let me think again.

The goal is to compute the sum of each row. So for each row i, sum all elements from column 0 to N-1. So for each row i, the thread needs to read N elements and sum them. But if each thread is responsible for a single row, then each thread would have to read N elements. But for a 2D tensor, each row is contiguous. So for row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j for j in 0..N-1.

So the kernel can be structured as follows: each thread is assigned a row index i. Then, for that row, the thread reads all N elements and sums them. Then, the sum is stored in the output tensor.

But how to handle the memory access. Let's think about the input tensor. Let's

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is to compute the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. Since the tensor is [M, N], each row has N elements, and we need to sum each row and then divide by N. So for each row i, the mean is sum(row_i) / N.

Now, considering Triton kernels, I need to figure out how to process this efficiently. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA, but with more abstraction. The key is to use shared memory and proper memory access patterns to maximize throughput.

Let me break down the steps:

1. **GPU Operations**: For each row, sum the elements and then divide by N. So, the kernel needs to process each row, sum its elements, and then compute the mean.

2. **Input/Output Shapes**: The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

3. **Block Sizes and Memory Access**: Since each row is processed independently, I can divide the rows into blocks. Each block can handle a certain number of rows. The block size should be chosen to maximize occupancy. For example, using a block size of 1024 might be good, but I need to check how many rows can be processed per block. However, since each row is processed independently, maybe each thread can handle one row. Wait, but if the number of rows is large, using a single thread per row might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each thread processes a single element in a row, but that would require more threads. Alternatively, using a block per row, where each block processes one row. But with N elements per row, that might not be efficient. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the kernel should be structured so that each thread handles a single row. For example, if there are M rows, each thread is responsible for one row. Then, for each row, the thread would sum all N elements in that row. But how to do that efficiently?

Alternatively, maybe we can process each row in a way that each thread handles a portion of the row. But since the row is of length N, and N can be large, perhaps using a block size that allows multiple threads to process different elements of the same row. However, since the sum is required, we need to accumulate the sum for each row.

Wait, but for each row, the sum is the sum of all elements in that row. So, for a given row i, the thread can iterate over all elements in that row and add them up. However, if the row is long, this could be slow. So, perhaps we need to use a block size that can process multiple elements per thread, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured with each thread handling a single element in a row, and then the threads in a warp combine their results. But that would require a lot of threads for each row. For example, if a row has N elements, and each thread processes one element, then for each row, we need N threads. But if M is large, this could be a lot of threads. However, Triton's warp size is 32, so maybe we can arrange the threads in a way that each warp processes a portion of the row.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is designed to process each row in a block. Let's think about the input tensor. Let's assume that the input is stored in a 2D grid, with each row being contiguous in memory. The kernel will process each row, and for each row, sum all elements.

So, the kernel will have a loop over the rows, and for each row, loop over the elements in the row. But in Triton, the kernel is written with a grid and a block structure. Let's think about the grid and block dimensions.

The kernel should be launched with a grid that has M blocks, each block processing one row. But how to structure the threads within a block. For example, each block can have multiple threads that process different elements of the same row. But since each row has N elements, maybe each thread in the block processes one element. However, with N elements, that would require N threads per block, which might not be efficient if N is large.

Alternatively, perhaps each block processes a single row, and each thread in the block processes a single element of that row. But that would require that the number of threads per block is equal to N. However, if N is large, this could be a problem. For example, if N is 1024, then each block would need 1024 threads,

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first matrix is MxK, the second is KxN, so the result should be MxN. Each element in the output is the sum of the products of elements from the rows of the first matrix and columns of the second matrix.

In Triton, I need to structure the kernel to handle this efficiently. Let me recall how Triton works. The kernel is written in a way that uses threads to process elements, with blocks handling rows or columns. For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to have each block compute a portion of the output matrix.

So, for each element (i, j) in the output matrix, we need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. But how to do this in Triton?

I remember that in Triton, each thread can handle a single element of the output. But for efficiency, we need to process multiple elements in a block. However, since the matrices are of size MxK and KxN, the number of elements per block might depend on how we partition the problem.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors are stored in row-major order. So, for the first matrix A (MxK), each row is stored contiguously. Similarly, B (KxN) has each row stored contiguously. The output C (MxN) will also be stored in row-major order.

In Triton, the kernel will process each element of C. But to do this efficiently, we need to compute the sum over k for each i and j. However, if we have a thread per element, that might be too slow because each thread would have to loop over K elements. That would be O(K) per thread, which is not efficient.

Wait, but in matrix multiplication, the standard approach is to have each block compute a portion of the output. For example, each block could handle a certain number of rows and columns. However, in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements, and each thread computes one element. But for large K, this would be slow.

Alternatively, maybe I can use a more optimized approach by using shared memory. But since the user hasn't specified any constraints on memory, perhaps the straightforward approach is better, but with some optimizations.

Wait, the user wants a Triton kernel, so I need to structure it with the @triton.jit decorator. Let me recall the structure of a Triton kernel.

The kernel will have parameters for the input tensors, their strides, and the output tensor. The kernel will loop over the elements of the output matrix, and for each element (i, j), compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But how to handle the indices? Let me think about the indices for the input tensors. For A, which is MxK, each row is stored as a contiguous block. So, for a given i (row in A), the elements are A[i][0], A[i][1], ..., A[i][K-1]. Similarly for B, which is KxN, each row is stored as B[k][0], B[k][1], ..., B[k][N-1].

In Triton, the kernel will have to compute for each (i, j) in the output matrix. But how to structure the loops? Since the output matrix is MxN, the kernel will need to iterate over i and j. However, in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements, and each thread computes one element.

But for each element (i, j), we need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, for each thread, we have to loop over k from 0 to K-1, multiply A[i][k] and B[k][j], and accumulate the sum.

But this would be O(K) per thread, which is not efficient for large K. However, in Triton, the kernel can be optimized by using a block size that allows for more efficient computation. Alternatively, maybe we can use a different approach where each block handles multiple elements.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a more optimized approach by using a block size that allows for computing multiple elements in parallel. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Another approach is to use the standard matrix multiplication approach where each block handles a portion of the matrix. For example, each block could handle a certain number of rows and columns. However, in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements, and each thread computes one element.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel can be written with a loop over the K dimension,

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first matrix is MxK, the second is KxN, so the result should be MxN. Each element in the result is the sum of the products of elements from the rows of the first matrix and columns of the second matrix.

In Triton, I need to handle this with a kernel that can process these operations efficiently. Let me recall how Triton works. The kernel is divided into blocks, and each block processes a certain number of elements. The key is to choose the right block size and memory access patterns to maximize throughput.

For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that allows for efficient coalesced memory access. Typically, for a matrix multiply, you might use a block size that can handle multiple elements in each row and column. Let's think about the dimensions. Let's say each block handles a certain number of rows and columns. But since the matrices are MxK and KxN, the K dimension is the same for both, so that's where the inner loop will be.

Wait, in matrix multiplication, the inner loop is over the K dimension. So for each element in the result matrix (i, j), we compute sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So in the kernel, each thread will compute one element of the result. But how to organize this in Triton?

In Triton, threads are organized into blocks. Each block can handle a certain number of rows and columns. Let me think about the layout. Let's say each block processes a certain number of rows (M) and columns (N). But since the matrices are MxK and KxN, the K dimension is the same for both. So maybe the block size is chosen such that each thread can process a certain number of elements in the K dimension.

Wait, but in the standard matrix multiplication, each thread computes one element of the result. So for each element (i,j), the thread computes sum_{k} A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So in the kernel, each thread would have to iterate over k, multiply the elements, and accumulate the sum.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the K dimension. However, for efficiency, we need to make sure that the memory accesses are coalesced. So, the key is to have each thread process a certain number of K elements, but that might not be possible if the K dimension is too small. Alternatively, perhaps we can use a block size that allows for multiple K elements to be processed per thread, but that might not be efficient.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element of the result. So, for each thread, we have i (row index in the first matrix), j (column index in the second matrix), and k (the index in the K dimension). But how to map this to the Triton kernel.

Alternatively, in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the K dimension. Let me think about the parameters. The kernel needs to take the two input tensors and the output tensor. The input tensors are of shape [M, K] and [K, N]. The output is [M, N].

In Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the K dimension. Let me think about the variables. For each thread, we can have a row index i in the first matrix (M), and a column index j in the second matrix (N). Then, for each k in 0 to K-1, we multiply A[i][k] and B[k][j], and sum them up.

But how to structure this in the kernel. Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors are stored in row-major order. So for the first matrix A, each row is stored contiguously. Similarly for B. So, for a given i and j, the elements A[i][k] and B[k][j] can be accessed with appropriate offsets.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the K dimension. So, for each thread, we need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

Now, the problem is to handle this efficiently. Let's think about the block size. Let's say each block has a certain number of threads. For example, if we choose a block size of 128, then each block can process multiple elements. But for matrix multiplication, the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element. However, that might not be efficient for very small K. Alternatively, perhaps we can use a block size that allows for multiple K elements to be processed per thread, but that might not be

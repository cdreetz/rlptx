Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The user mentioned using tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. Matrix multiplication involves computing each element of the resulting matrix as the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix. Since we're using shared memory, I should probably split the matrices into tiles that fit into shared memory. The key here is to efficiently access the elements in a coalesced manner.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The first tensor is [M, K], the second is [K, N]. The output will be [M, N]. So, for each element in the output, we need to compute the sum over K elements. But with shared memory, I'll need to load chunks of the input matrices into shared memory so that each thread can process a part of the computation.

Optimal block sizes. Triton kernels usually use a block size that's a multiple of 32, like 128 or 256. But for matrix multiplication, the block size should be chosen such that each thread handles a tile. Maybe using a block size of 128, which is common for such operations. Each thread might handle a small tile of the matrices.

Memory access patterns. For each thread, I need to load a row from the first matrix (A) and a column from the second matrix (B) into shared memory. Then compute the dot product. But since the matrices are large, we'll have to split them into tiles. For example, if the block size is 128, each thread might handle a 16x16 tile (but that's just an example; the exact size depends on the shared memory size). Wait, maybe the block size is 128, and each thread is responsible for a certain part of the matrix. Alternatively, using a grid of threads where each thread computes a part of the result.

Wait, the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to have each thread compute a single element of the result. But with shared memory, we can load chunks of A and B into shared memory to avoid repeated memory accesses. So, for each thread, we need to compute the dot product of a row from A and a column from B. However, if the matrices are large, we need to split them into tiles. For example, if the block size is 128, each thread might handle a 16x16 tile of A and B. But I need to think about how to split the matrices into tiles that fit into shared memory.

Let me think about the shared memory. Suppose each thread loads a block of A and B into shared memory. For example, if the block size is 128, then each thread might be responsible for a 16x16 tile of A and B. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the shared memory is used to store a block of A and B, and each thread computes a part of the result.

Alternatively, the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element of the result. But with shared memory, we can load a block of A and B into shared memory, and then compute the dot product. For example, if the block size is 128, then each thread can compute a part of the dot product by accessing elements in the shared memory. But how?

Let me recall the standard Triton matrix multiplication kernel. The kernel typically uses a block size of 128, and each thread is responsible for a certain part of the matrix. The matrices are split into tiles, and each thread computes a part of the dot product. The shared memory is used to store the tiles of A and B. Then, for each element in the result, the threads compute the sum over the K elements.

So, for the kernel, the steps would be:

1. Determine the block size (e.g., 128).
2. For each thread in the block, compute the index in the output matrix (i, j).
3. Load the corresponding row from A and column from B into shared memory.
4. Compute the dot product using the shared memory elements.
5. Store the result in the output matrix.

But how to split the matrices into tiles? The shared memory is used to store a tile of A and B. For example, if the block size is 128, then each thread might be responsible for a 16x16 tile of A and B. Wait, but that's not clear. Alternatively, the shared memory is used to store a block of A and B, and each thread computes a part of the dot product.

Alternatively, the kernel is structured such that each thread computes a single element of the result. For each element (i, j), the thread computes the sum

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through the steps.

First, the GPU operations. Matrix multiplication involves multiplying elements of the first matrix with corresponding elements of the second matrix and summing the products. Since we're using shared memory, I should divide the problem into tiles. Each tile will be stored in shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.

The input tensors are A (M, K) and B (K, N). The output is C (M, N), where each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

For tile-based computation, I'll need to split the matrices into blocks. Let's choose a block size, say BLOCK_SIZE = 128. Each thread block will handle a tile of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) from each matrix. But wait, since A is M x K and B is K x N, the tiles need to be compatible. Let me think about how to structure the tiles.

Each thread in the block will compute a part of the output. The key is to have each thread compute a single element of C. But with shared memory, we can load a block of A and B into shared memory, then compute the dot product of the corresponding rows and columns.

Wait, maybe I should structure the kernel such that each thread block handles a tile of A and B. For example, each thread block computes a tile of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) in C. But since A is M x K and B is K x N, the tiles need to be aligned such that the rows of A and columns of B fit into the shared memory.

Alternatively, each thread block can handle a tile of A (size BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE) and a tile of B (size BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE), and compute the corresponding part of C. But how does that fit with the original matrix dimensions?

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to split the matrices into tiles of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). For each tile in A and B, compute the corresponding tile in C. But since A is M x K and B is K x N, the tiles need to be arranged so that the rows of A and columns of B fit into the shared memory.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in global memory. Each thread block will load a tile of A and B into shared memory. Then, each thread in the block computes a part of the dot product between a row of A and a column of B.

But how to structure the threads. Let me think: each thread in the block will compute a single element of C. For that, the thread needs to compute the dot product of a row from A and a column from B. However, with shared memory, we can load a block of A and B into shared memory, and then each thread can compute the dot product of a row from A and a column from B.

Wait, maybe the threads are arranged in a grid where each thread block handles a tile of A and B. For example, each thread block is responsible for a tile of A (size BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE) and a tile of B (size BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE). Then, the output tile C is of size (BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE). However, since A is M x K and B is K x N, the tiles need to be such that the rows of A and columns of B fit into the shared memory.

Alternatively, each thread block computes a tile of C. For that, the tile size would be (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). But how to split the matrices into tiles. Let's assume that the tiles are of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) for A and B. Then, the number of tiles in A would be ceil(M / BLOCK_SIZE) and ceil(K / BLOCK_SIZE), and similarly for B.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the kernel structure. The kernel should take the input tensors A and B, and compute the output tensor C. The kernel will be launched with a grid of threads that handle each element of C.

But with shared memory, the approach is to load a block of A and B into shared memory, then compute the dot product. For example, each thread block handles a tile of A (rows i to i+BLOCK_SIZE-1) and a tile of B (columns j to j+BLOCK_SIZE-1), and computes the corresponding element of C.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to have each thread block compute a tile of C. For each tile in C, we need to compute the product of a block of A (rows i to i+BLOCK_SIZE-1) and a block of B (columns j to j+BLOCK_SIZE-1

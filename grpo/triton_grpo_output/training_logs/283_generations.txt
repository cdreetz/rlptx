Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through the steps.

First, I remember that matrix multiplication involves computing each element of the resulting matrix as the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix. But since we're using tile-based computation, we'll break down the matrices into smaller blocks that fit into shared memory.

So, the input tensors are A (M x K) and B (K x N). The output tensor C (M x N) will be computed as C = A * B. Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

In Triton, I'll need to handle the computation in blocks. Let's decide on the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 elements is common. Let's go with 32 elements per block for each dimension. Wait, but for shared memory, the block size should be chosen such that the tiles fit into the shared memory. Let me check the typical approach.

In the standard matrix multiplication with shared memory, each thread block handles a tile of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread block processes a 32x32 tile of the matrices. But since the matrices are of size M x K and K x N, the tiles need to be aligned such that the blocks can be loaded into shared memory.

Wait, the first matrix A is M x K, and the second B is K x N. So, for each tile of A, we'll need to load a block of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) into shared memory. But since K might be larger than the block size, we'll need to process multiple tiles along the K dimension.

But in the Triton kernel, each thread will handle a specific element of the output matrix. Let me think about the thread indices. Each thread will compute one element of C. But with tile-based computation, threads will work on tiles of A and B, and compute the sum over the K dimension.

Wait, perhaps I should structure the kernel such that each thread block handles a tile of A and a tile of B. But since the problem is to compute C = A * B, each thread block would compute a portion of the output matrix. However, in the standard approach, each thread block handles a tile of A and a tile of B, and computes the corresponding tile of C.

But given that the user wants tile-based computation with shared memory, I need to structure the kernel to load tiles of A and B into shared memory, then compute the dot product between them.

So, the steps would be:

1. For each thread block, compute the starting row and column in the output matrix C that this block is responsible for.
2. Load the corresponding tile of A (size BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE) into shared memory.
3. Load the corresponding tile of B (size BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE) into shared memory.
4. Compute the dot product between the tiles of A and B, which gives the corresponding tile of C.
5. Store the result back into the output tensor.

But wait, the dimensions of A and B are M x K and K x N. So, for the tile-based approach, each thread block would process a tile of A (size TILE_M x TILE_K) and a tile of B (size TILE_K x TILE_N), where TILE_K is the block size. Then, the resulting tile of C would be TILE_M x TILE_N.

But in the standard approach, the block size is chosen such that TILE_K is the same as the block size. So, for example, if TILE_K is 32, then each thread block processes a 32x32 tile of A and a 32x32 tile of B, resulting in a 32x32 tile of C.

But the problem here is that the input matrices A and B have dimensions M x K and K x N. So, the tile size for A must be such that it fits into the shared memory. Let me think about the memory layout.

Each thread in the block will compute a single element of C. But with tile-based computation, threads will work on tiles of A and B, and compute the sum over the K dimension.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread computes a single element of C, but uses shared memory to store the relevant rows of A and columns of B. However, that might not be efficient. The standard approach is to use shared memory for tiles of A and B, and compute the dot product between them.

But in this case, the matrices are of different dimensions. Let me think again. Let's assume that the block

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The user wants tile-based computation using shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in Triton.

First, the matrices are A (MxK) and B (KxN). The result is C (MxN), where each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k. But doing this naively would be too slow, so we need to use tile-based computation with shared memory to optimize.

Triton kernels use shared memory to store tiles of the input matrices. The idea is to split the matrices into smaller blocks (tiles) that fit into shared memory, compute the product in parallel, and then combine the results.

So, the steps would be:

1. Determine the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 elements is common. Let's say 32 elements per thread, but maybe 16? Wait, the block size should be a multiple of the number of elements in each dimension. Let me think. For the A matrix, each thread would handle a block of K elements, and for B, each thread would handle a block of N elements. Wait, maybe the block size is determined by the number of elements each thread processes in each matrix.

Wait, in matrix multiplication, each thread typically handles a tile of size (block_size, block_size). So, for the A matrix, each thread would process a block of K elements (since A is MxK), and for B, a block of N elements (since B is KxN). So the block size for each matrix would be determined by how many elements each thread processes in each dimension.

But maybe the block size is chosen based on the number of elements per thread. Let me think. For example, if each thread processes a block of size (block_size, block_size), then for matrix A (MxK), each thread would handle a block of K elements in the column direction. So, the block size for the rows in A would be determined by how many rows each thread processes. Similarly for B.

Alternatively, maybe the block size is chosen such that each thread handles a block of size (block_size, block_size) in the matrix. For example, if the block size is 16, then each thread would process 16 rows and 16 columns in the matrix. But this depends on the actual matrix dimensions.

Wait, the user specified tile-based computation with shared memory. So, the standard approach is to use a block size that allows for efficient memory access. For example, in the standard matrix multiplication, each thread computes a block of size (block_size, block_size) in the result matrix. But in this case, since the matrices are A (MxK) and B (KxN), the tile size would be determined by how many elements each thread processes in each matrix.

Let me think about the shared memory. Each thread would load a tile of A and a tile of B into shared memory, compute the dot product of the tiles, and then write the result to the output matrix.

So, for the A matrix (MxK), each thread would load a block of K elements. Similarly, for B (KxN), each thread would load a block of N elements. But how to structure this in the kernel.

In the kernel, each thread would be responsible for computing a certain part of the result matrix. Let's say that each thread is responsible for computing a block of size (block_size, block_size) in the result matrix. But since the matrices are A (MxK) and B (KxN), the actual computation would involve multiplying a row of A (size K) with a column of B (size K), resulting in a single element of C (size MxN).

Wait, but that's the standard approach. So, for each element C[i][j], we need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, each thread would compute one element of C. However, if we use tile-based computation, we can process multiple elements at once.

But perhaps the standard approach is to split the matrices into tiles. For example, each thread block processes a tile of A and a tile of B, computes the product, and then writes the result into C.

But in this case, the matrices are A (MxK) and B (KxN). So, for the tile-based approach, each tile of A would be of size (block_rows, block_cols) where block_rows is the number of rows in the tile, and block_cols is the number of columns in the tile. Similarly for B. However, since A is MxK, the tile size for A would be (block_rows

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The user wants tile-based computation using shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in Triton.

First, the input tensors are A (M,K) and B (K,N). The output is C (M,N), where each element C[i,j] is the sum of A[i,k] * B[k,j] for all k. But doing this naively would be inefficient, so tile-based computation with shared memory is better.

In Triton, I should use shared memory to store tiles of the matrices. The idea is to divide the matrices into blocks (tiles) that fit into shared memory. For each block, we compute the product and store the result in the output.

Let me think about the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 elements is used. Let's say we use a block size of 32. But wait, the block size needs to be a multiple of the number of elements in each dimension. Maybe I should use a block size that allows for efficient computation. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread can handle a 32x32 tile. But I need to make sure that the threads are arranged in a way that each thread computes a part of the product.

Wait, the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to have each thread compute a single element of the result. But that's not efficient. Instead, using tile-based computation, each thread block processes a tile of the matrices. So, for each tile, we load the corresponding part of A and B into shared memory, compute the product, and then write the result back to global memory.

But how to structure the threads? Let me think. For each thread block, we can process a tile of size (block_size, block_size). So, for matrix A (M,K), each thread block would handle a tile of size (block_size, block_size), and similarly for B (K,N). The output matrix C (M,N) would be processed in tiles of size (block_size, block_size) as well.

Wait, but the dimensions of A and B are M x K and K x N. So, for the matrix multiplication, each tile of A (size block_size x block_size) would be multiplied with a tile of B (size block_size x block_size), resulting in a tile of C (block_size x block_size). But how does this fit into the overall dimensions?

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured to compute each element of C. But that's not efficient. So, the tile-based approach is better. Let me look up the standard Triton matrix multiplication example.

In the standard Triton matrix multiplication, each thread block handles a tile of the matrices. The kernel is divided into rows and columns. Each thread in the block computes a part of the product. For example, each thread computes a single element of the result. But that's not tile-based. Wait, perhaps the tile-based approach is more efficient when the matrices are large and the block size is chosen to fit into shared memory.

Alternatively, the kernel could be structured to compute a block of the result matrix. Let me think about the steps:

1. For each thread block, determine which tile of A and B it is responsible for.
2. Load the corresponding tiles of A and B into shared memory.
3. Compute the product of the tiles, which will contribute to the corresponding tile of C.
4. Write the computed tile back to global memory.

But how to structure the threads in the block for this? Let's assume that the block size is 32, so each thread block has 32x32 threads. Then, each thread would be responsible for computing a single element of the result. But that's the same as the standard approach. However, using shared memory, we can load the tiles into shared memory and compute the product more efficiently.

Wait, perhaps the tile size is larger. For example, if the block size is 16, then each thread block can handle a 16x16 tile. But this depends on the actual matrix dimensions.

Alternatively, the kernel is structured to compute each element of C, but using shared memory to store the rows of A and columns of B. For example, each thread block processes a row of A and a column of B. But that's not exactly tile-based.

Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of the standard Triton matrix multiplication kernel. Let me recall the standard approach.

In the standard approach, each thread computes a single element of the result. The threads are arranged in a grid where each thread block processes a row of the result matrix. However, to make this efficient, the threads in the block compute the elements of the result matrix in a way that allows for efficient memory access.

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through the steps.

First, I remember that matrix multiplication involves computing the dot product of rows from the first matrix and columns from the second matrix. For efficient computation, especially on GPUs, using shared memory and tiling is crucial to reduce memory latency and improve performance.

So, the input tensors are A (M x K) and B (K x N). The output is C (M x N), where each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k.

In Triton, I need to structure the kernel to handle this. The key steps are:

1. **Memory Layout and Shapes**: The input tensors are stored in row-major order. The output tensor C will be stored in the same way. The kernel needs to process each element of C by computing the dot product of the corresponding row from A and column from B.

2. **Shared Memory Usage**: To optimize, I'll use shared memory to store tiles of A and B. The tile size (block size) should be chosen such that it's a multiple of the matrix dimensions. Typically, a block size of 32 or 64 is used. Let's say we use 32 as the block size. So, each thread block will handle a tile of size (block_size x block_size) from A and B.

3. **Tile-based Computation**: Each thread block will compute a block of the output matrix C. For each tile, the threads will compute the dot product of the corresponding row in A and column in B. The number of tiles in each dimension depends on the sizes of M, K, and N.

4. **Memory Access Patterns**: The threads should access elements in a coalesced manner. For A, each thread will access a row, and for B, each thread will access a column. The shared memory will store the tiles of A and B, so that each thread can access them in a contiguous manner.

5. **Edge Cases**: If the dimensions are not multiples of the block size, there might be leftover elements. The kernel needs to handle these by checking if the indices are within bounds and using masks to avoid out-of-bounds accesses.

Now, let's think about the parameters. The kernel will take the input tensors A and B, and the output tensor C. The block size is a constant, say 32. The kernel will iterate over the tiles of A and B.

Each thread in the block will compute a single element of C. Wait, no. Actually, in matrix multiplication, each thread block computes a block of C. For example, if the block size is 32, each thread block will compute a 32x32 block of C. But how does that work with the threads?

Alternatively, each thread block can handle a tile of A and a tile of B, and compute the corresponding tile of C. The number of threads per block would be block_size squared. Each thread in the block would compute one element of C by multiplying the corresponding element of A and B and adding to the result.

Wait, but that might not be efficient. Maybe each thread block handles a tile of A and B, and each thread computes a single element of C. But that would require more threads. Alternatively, using a more efficient approach where each thread computes a single element of C, but with shared memory.

Let me recall the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton. The standard approach is to have each thread compute one element of C. However, with shared memory, we can load tiles of A and B into shared memory, and then compute the dot product for each element of C.

So, for each element C[i][j], the thread will compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. But to do this efficiently, we can load the row i of A into shared memory, and the column j of B into shared memory, then compute the dot product.

But in practice, for a tile-based approach, the kernel would process tiles of A and B. For example, if the block size is 32, each thread block handles a tile of A (size 32x32) and a tile of B (size 32x32), and computes the corresponding tile of C (32x32). However, the exact way to do this depends on the tile size.

Alternatively, the kernel could be structured such that each thread block handles a tile of A and a tile of B, and each thread in the block computes a single element of C. But this would require that the threads are arranged in a way that each thread computes one element.

But perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element of C. Let

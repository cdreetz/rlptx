Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the maximum element). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the max of N elements.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the maximum of the corresponding row.

Memory layout: The input is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. The output is a 1D array where each element corresponds to a row's maximum.

Optimal block sizes and memory access. Since each row has N elements, and we need to process all elements in a row, the block size should be chosen such that each thread can handle a portion of the row. But since we need to compute the max, which is a reduction operation, we need to handle the reduction efficiently.

For a 2D tensor, each row is of length N. So, for each row, we can process it in a way that threads work together to compute the max. The number of threads per block should be such that each thread can handle a chunk of elements in the row, and then combine the results.

But since the reduction is along the last dimension, perhaps we can process each row independently. So, for each row, we can have a set of threads that compute the max of that row. However, in Triton, we usually process elements in a grid that's divided into blocks, each handling a portion of the data.

Wait, maybe the approach is to have each thread handle a single element in the row, but then perform a reduction across the threads. But that might not be efficient if N is large. Alternatively, we can use a block size that allows for efficient reduction.

Alternatively, for each row, we can process it in a way that threads work together to compute the max. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block can process a portion of the row. But since the row is of length N, we need to determine how many threads per block are needed to process the row.

Alternatively, since the reduction is along the last dimension, perhaps we can process each row as a separate reduction. So, for each row, we have a set of threads that compute the max of that row. But how to structure this in Triton?

Wait, in Triton, the kernel is launched with a grid of blocks, each block processing a certain range of elements. So, for the 2D tensor, each row is processed by a block. But how to handle that.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread handles a single element in the row, and then the threads in the block perform a reduction to find the max for that row.

But for that, the block size needs to be such that each block can process all elements of a row. However, if the row is of length N, then the number of threads per block would be N. But that's not efficient for large N. So perhaps we need to use a block size that allows for efficient reduction, like using a power of two.

Wait, maybe the approach is to have each thread handle a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction across the threads in the block. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block can process up to 128 elements in the row. But if the row is longer than 128 elements, then multiple blocks would be needed for that row. But how to handle that.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured to process each row in a way that each thread handles a portion of the row, and then the threads in the block perform a reduction. But this requires that the block size is a power of two, and that the number of threads per block is chosen to be a power of two.

So, for each row, the number of elements is N. So, the block size should be chosen such that each block can handle a chunk of elements. However, since the reduction is along the row, perhaps the block size is chosen as a power of two, and the threads in the block perform a reduction.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let's think of the kernel as processing each row. So, for each row, the kernel will process all N elements and compute the max. So, the kernel should be designed to process each row in a way that the threads in the block work together to compute the max.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a grid and blocks. So, the grid is determined by the number of rows,

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the max of the elements in that row). So for each row (each M row), we need to compute the maximum of N elements.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the maximum of the corresponding row.

Memory layout: The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. The output tensor will be a 1D array where each element corresponds to a row's maximum.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Since we're processing each row independently, we can process each row in a separate thread block. But how to structure the threads? Let's think about how many threads per block. For each row, we need to process N elements. If we have a block size that can handle the elements in a row, maybe we can use a block size that's a power of two, like 256. But since each row has N elements, the number of threads per block would be the number of elements in a row. However, if N is not a multiple of the block size, we might need to handle that. Alternatively, we can use a block size that's a power of two, and process each row in a way that each thread handles a portion of the elements in the row.

Wait, but for max reduction, it's common to use a parallel reduction approach. So for each row, we can have threads that compute the max of a subset of elements, then combine them. But since the rows are independent, maybe we can process each row in a separate block. However, with Triton, each block can process a row, and each thread in the block can handle a portion of the row's elements.

Alternatively, for each row, the threads can be arranged to compute the max. Let's consider that each thread in the block is responsible for a certain position in the row. For example, if the block has 256 threads, and the row has N elements, then each thread can take care of a chunk of elements. But for max reduction, we need to process all elements in the row. So maybe each thread is responsible for a single element, and then they combine their results. But that would require a reduction step within the block.

Wait, but if the row has N elements, and each thread is responsible for a single element, then the block can perform a reduction to find the maximum. However, if N is larger than the number of threads in the block, we need to split the elements into chunks. For example, if the block has 256 threads, and the row has 1024 elements, then each thread can handle 4 elements. But that's more complex. Alternatively, for each row, we can have threads that process elements in a way that allows for parallel reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the block is responsible for processing a single row. For each row, the threads in the block can compute the maximum. Let's think about the steps:

For each row i in 0..M-1:
   For each element in row i, compute the maximum.

But how to structure this in Triton. The kernel will have a loop over the rows, and for each row, process the elements. So the kernel will have a loop over the rows, and for each row, process the elements in that row.

So the kernel will have a loop over the rows. For each row, we need to compute the maximum of N elements. So for each row, the threads in the block can be assigned to process a subset of the elements in that row.

But how to handle the thread indices. Let's say we have a block size of 256. For each row, the threads in the block can be assigned to process elements in that row. For example, if the row has N elements, then each thread can take care of a chunk of elements. But for max reduction, we can use a parallel reduction approach.

Alternatively, for each row, the threads can be arranged to compute the max in a reduction tree. For example, the first level of reduction combines pairs of elements, then the next level combines the results, and so on until we get the maximum.

But how to structure this. Let's think about the parameters. The kernel will need to know the number of rows (M) and the number of columns (N). The kernel will be launched with a grid size that covers all rows. For each row, the block processes the elements in that row.

So the

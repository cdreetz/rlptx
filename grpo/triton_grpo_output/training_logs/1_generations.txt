Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through the steps.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The two input matrices are A (MxK) and B (KxN), and the output is C (MxN), where each element C[i,j] is the sum of A[i,k] * B[k,j] for all k. But since we're using shared memory, we need to break this into tiles.

Triton kernels work with threads, so I need to figure out how to partition the computation into blocks. The key is to use shared memory to store tiles of the matrices, which reduces the number of global memory accesses.

Let me recall the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton. The kernel typically has a loop over the rows of the first matrix (A) and columns of the second matrix (B), with each thread handling a single element of the result. But with shared memory, we can load tiles of A and B into shared memory, then compute the dot product of the tiles.

So, the steps would be:

1. Determine the block size. For matrix multiplication, a common choice is to use a block size that allows for efficient computation. For example, a block size of 32 or 64, but since we're using shared memory, maybe 128? Wait, the block size is determined by the number of elements each thread processes. For example, if each thread computes a tile of size (block_size x block_size), then the block size is chosen based on the matrix dimensions.

Wait, but in the standard approach, each thread handles a single element of the result matrix. However, with shared memory, we can load tiles of A and B into shared memory, and then compute the dot product. So, for each tile of A (size (block_size x block_size)), and each tile of B (size (block_size x block_size)), the dot product would be computed as the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. But to do this, each thread would need to process a block of elements.

Alternatively, perhaps each thread is responsible for a block of the result matrix. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of how the threads are arranged. For example, in the standard approach, each thread is responsible for a single element of C. But with shared memory, we can load a tile of A and B into shared memory, then compute the dot product for that tile.

So, the kernel would have multiple threads, each handling a different tile of the matrices. But how to structure this.

Alternatively, the kernel could be structured such that each thread block handles a block of the result matrix. For example, if the block size is 16x16, then each thread block processes a 16x16 block of the result matrix. But I need to make sure that the shared memory is used to store the tiles of A and B.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input matrices A and B are stored in global memory. The kernel will load tiles of A and B into shared memory. For example, if the tile size is (block_size, block_size), then each tile of A is stored in shared memory, and each tile of B is stored in shared memory. Then, for each tile of A and B, we compute the dot product for the corresponding block of C.

But how to map the threads to the tiles. Let's consider that each thread block is responsible for a certain region of the matrices. For example, if the matrix A is of size M x K, and the tile size is (block_size, block_size), then the number of tiles along the rows of A would be ceil(M / block_size), and similarly for columns. But this might be complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is designed such that each thread block handles a block of the result matrix. For example, each thread block is responsible for a block of size (block_size x block_size) in the result matrix. Then, the threads within the block compute the dot product for each element of that block.

But I need to think about the shared memory. Let me try to outline the steps:

1. The kernel is launched with a grid that covers all the elements of the result matrix C. Each thread in the kernel is responsible for computing a single element of C.

But that's the standard approach, which doesn't use shared memory. To use shared memory, we need to load tiles of A and B into shared memory, and then compute the dot product for each tile.

So, the kernel would have to be structured such that each thread block handles a tile of A and a tile of B, and then compute the dot product for the corresponding block of C.

But how to do this in Triton. Let me

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that matrix multiplication involves taking the dot product of rows from the first matrix and columns from the second matrix. For efficient computation on GPUs, especially with Triton, using shared memory is crucial to reduce global memory access latency. So, I need to figure out how to tile the matrices into blocks that can be stored in shared memory.

Let me think about the dimensions. The first matrix is M x K, and the second is K x N. The result will be M x N. The key is to compute each element of the result by multiplying corresponding elements from the first matrix's row and the second matrix's column, then summing them up.

In Triton, each kernel launch is handled by multiple threads. Each thread can compute one element of the result. But to make this efficient, I should organize the threads into blocks that process a tile of the matrices. The block size is usually chosen based on the hardware, but for this problem, maybe 32 or 64 elements per block?

Wait, shared memory is limited, so the tiles should be small enough to fit in shared memory. Let's say each tile is of size 16x16. But I need to adjust based on the actual matrix dimensions. Alternatively, maybe the block size is determined by the number of elements that can fit in shared memory. For example, if each thread handles a tile of size 16x16, then each thread would compute a part of the result.

But how to structure the threads. Let me think: each thread would be responsible for computing one element of the result. However, that might not be efficient. Instead, using a tile-based approach where each thread block processes a block of the matrices.

Wait, maybe the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to use a block size that can handle a tile of K elements. For example, each thread block processes a block of K elements from the first matrix and a block of K elements from the second matrix. But since the first matrix is M x K and the second is K x N, the tiles would be of size (block_size, block_size), where block_size is the number of elements per dimension.

Alternatively, the standard approach is to use a block size that allows for efficient computation. Let me recall: for matrix multiplication, each thread block typically handles a tile of size (block_size, block_size), where block_size is chosen based on the hardware. For example, using 16x16 tiles. But since the first matrix is M x K and the second is K x N, the tiles would be of size (block_size, block_size), and the threads would compute the dot product between the rows of the first matrix and columns of the second matrix.

Wait, but in this case, the first matrix is M x K, and the second is K x N. So, for each element (i, j) in the result, we need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, the threads would need to compute this sum.

But how to structure this in Triton. Each thread block would process a block of rows from the first matrix and columns from the second matrix. Let me think about the memory layout. The first matrix is stored in global memory as a 2D array, and the second matrix is also stored as a 2D array. The result is stored in global memory as a 2D array.

But for shared memory, each thread block would load a tile of the first matrix and a tile of the second matrix into shared memory. Then, each thread within the block would compute a part of the dot product.

Wait, maybe the standard approach is to use a block size of 32, and each thread block processes a tile of size (block_size, block_size). For example, each thread block handles a block of K elements from the first matrix and a block of K elements from the second matrix. Then, the threads in the block compute the dot product between the rows of the first matrix and columns of the second matrix.

But I need to think about how to split the matrices into tiles. Let me consider that the first matrix is M x K, and the second is K x N. The result is M x N. So, for each element (i, j) in the result, we need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

In Triton, each thread can compute one element of the result. But that's not efficient. Instead, we can use a tile-based approach where each thread block processes a block of the matrices. Let's say each thread block handles a block of size (block_size, block_size) in

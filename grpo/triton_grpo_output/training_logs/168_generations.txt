Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is to find the maximum value in each row of a 2D tensor. Since the tensor is [M, N], each row has N elements, and we want the max for each row. So for each row, we need to compare all elements and find the maximum.

Triton kernels work with threads in blocks. So I need to figure out how to structure the threads to process each row. Let's think about the grid and block sizes. Each thread should handle a single row. But wait, maybe not. Wait, if each row is processed by a thread, then the number of threads would be M. But Triton's grid is determined by the number of blocks and threads per block. So perhaps I can have each block process a single row. But how?

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, but that might not be efficient. Wait, no. For a max reduction, each thread can be responsible for a single element in the row, and then compare with others. But that's not the standard approach. The standard approach for max reduction is to have each thread process a range of elements, but in this case, since the rows are independent, maybe each thread can handle a single element and then compare with others.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, the max reduction can be done with a parallel reduction. So perhaps each thread is part of a reduction tree. However, since the rows are independent, maybe each row can be processed by a separate block. So each block processes a single row, and within that block, performs the reduction.

But how to structure that. Let me think. For each row, the thread block would process the elements in that row. So for a row of N elements, the block would have multiple threads working on that row. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block can process a row of N elements, and the threads in the block would perform the reduction.

But how to split the elements in the row into chunks for the threads. Let's think about the standard max reduction in Triton. The standard approach is to have each thread handle a chunk of elements, and then compare with others. For example, in a 1D reduction, each thread takes a portion of the array, and then compares with the next thread's result, and so on.

But in this case, since the rows are independent, perhaps each block is responsible for a single row. So for each row, the block will process the elements in that row. So the block will have multiple threads, each handling a part of the row.

So the steps would be:

1. For each row (i.e., each block), process the elements in that row.
2. Each thread in the block is responsible for a subset of the elements in the row.
3. The threads perform a reduction to find the maximum.

But how to structure the threads. Let's say the block size is 128. For a row of N elements, each thread can handle a chunk of elements. For example, if N is 1024, then each thread can handle 8 elements (1024 / 128 = 8). Then, each thread would compute the max of its chunk, and then compare with the next thread's max, and so on.

But in this case, the number of threads per block depends on the row length. So perhaps we need to compute how many threads per block are needed for each row. But that's complicated. Alternatively, we can use a fixed block size, and for each row, the threads will process the elements in that row, but with some padding if necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction. But that would be inefficient because each thread would have to compare with all others. But with a reduction tree, that's manageable.

Wait, the standard approach for a 1D reduction is to have each thread take a portion of the array, and then compare with the next thread's value. For example, in a 1D array of size N, each thread i takes elements starting at i * (N / num_threads), and then compares with the next thread's value. But in this case, since the rows are independent, each row can be processed by a block, and the block's threads perform the reduction.

So, the kernel would have:

- Each thread block processes a single row.
- The threads in the block perform a reduction on the elements of that row.
- The result is stored in the output tensor.

So, first, the kernel needs to process each row. Let's think about the grid and block dimensions. The grid size would be M blocks

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is to find the maximum value in each row of the tensor. Since it's a 2D tensor, each row is of length N. So for each row (i.e., each row index M), I need to compute the maximum across all elements in that row.

Triton kernels work with threads in blocks. So I need to figure out how to partition the work across the threads. Let's think about the input tensor. The tensor has dimensions [M, N], so each row is of length N. The output should be a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the max of the corresponding row.

Now, for the kernel, I need to decide on the block size. Typically, for such reductions, a block size of 1024 is common, but maybe 256 or 512 could work too. But since the problem is per-row, maybe each thread can handle a portion of the row. Wait, but if each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, then for a row of N elements, we need N threads. But if N is large, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can use a reduction approach where each thread processes a subset of elements and reduces them.

Wait, but the problem is to compute the max of each row. So for each row, we can process all elements in that row. However, with Triton, each thread can process a single element, but if the row is long, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can use a reduction approach where each thread handles a group of elements and reduces them.

But for the max reduction, the standard approach is to have each thread handle a portion of the data, and then perform a reduction. However, since each row is independent, perhaps we can process each row in parallel.

Let me think about the steps:

1. Each thread is responsible for a row. Wait, but if the rows are M in number, then each thread can handle one row. But if M is large, that's not efficient. Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in a row, but that would require N threads per row. Hmm, but that's not efficient for large N.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a block size that allows each block to process a row. For example, if each block processes a row, then each block would have N elements to process. But that's not feasible if N is large, as each block would need to process N elements, which could be too much for a single block.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is designed to process each row in parallel. So for each row, we have a set of threads that compute the max. But how to structure that.

Wait, maybe the kernel is designed to process each row independently. So each thread is assigned a row index. Then, for that row, the thread needs to compute the max of all elements in that row. But how to do that with threads.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed such that each thread handles a single element in the row, and then performs a reduction. But that would require that each thread is responsible for a single element, and then they combine their results.

But for a row of N elements, if each thread is responsible for one element, then the number of threads per row is N. But that would require that the kernel is launched with a number of threads equal to M * N, which might not be efficient. However, Triton allows for dynamic thread counts.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a block size that allows for a reduction within the block. For example, each block processes a row, and within the block, the threads perform a reduction to find the max. But how to structure that.

Let me think of the standard approach for max reduction in a 1D array. For a 1D array of size N, you can have each thread handle a subset of elements, and then perform a reduction. For example, with a block size of 1024, each thread could handle a chunk of elements, and then the threads reduce their results.

But in this case, each row is a 1D array of N elements, and we need to compute the max for each row. So for each row, we can have a reduction across the elements.

So the kernel would process each row, and for each row, perform a reduction across the elements. But how to structure that in Triton.

So the steps for the kernel:

- The kernel is launched with M rows. Each thread is responsible for a row.

Wait, but if each thread is responsible for a row, then for each row, the thread needs to process all N elements. But that would require that each thread has access to

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is to calculate the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. Each row has N elements, so for each row (i.e., each row index m), I need to sum all elements in that row and then divide by N. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M].

Now, considering Triton kernels, I need to structure the code to handle this efficiently. Let me break down the steps:

1. **GPU Operations**: The main operations are summing elements in each row and then dividing by N. Since we're dealing with a 2D tensor, each thread will handle a specific row. But how to organize the threads?

2. **Input/Output Shapes**: The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N]. The output is a 1D tensor of shape [M]. Each element in the output is the mean of the corresponding row in the input.

3. **Block Sizes and Memory Access**: I need to decide on the block size. Since each row is processed independently, maybe each thread can handle a single row. However, for efficiency, perhaps using a block size that allows multiple threads to process different rows. Wait, but if each thread is responsible for a single row, then the number of threads per block would be M, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each thread processes a single element in the row, and the block handles the summation for a row. But that depends on how the threads are arranged.

Wait, for a 2D tensor, each row has N elements. So, for each row m, there are N elements. If I have a block size that can process all elements in a row, then each block can handle one row. But that might not be efficient if N is large. Alternatively, maybe each thread processes one element in the row, and the block computes the sum for that row. Let me think.

Let me consider that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. Then, for each row m, all threads in the block would process the elements in that row. But how to organize that. Alternatively, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single row, and then the thread computes the sum of that row. But that would require that each thread processes all N elements of the row. However, that might not be efficient if N is large, as each thread would have to process N elements. But for a 2D tensor, maybe it's better to have each thread process a single element in the row, and then the block computes the sum for that row.

Wait, but in Triton, each thread can process a single element. So, for a given row m, each thread in the block would process a single element in that row. Then, the block would sum all those elements. But how to organize the threads in the block. Let's think about the grid and blocks.

The grid should have as many blocks as there are rows (M). Each block processes one row. Then, within each block, the threads process the elements of that row. But how many threads per block? Let's say each block has BLOCK_SIZE threads. Then, each thread would process one element in the row. But for a row with N elements, if BLOCK_SIZE is larger than N, then some threads would be idle. Alternatively, we can compute the number of threads per block as the number of elements in the row, but that's not fixed. So maybe it's better to have the block process all elements of a row, but that might not be efficient if the row has a variable number of elements.

Alternatively, maybe each block is responsible for processing a single row. The number of threads per block is equal to the number of elements in the row. But that's not possible because the number of elements can vary. Wait, but in this case, the tensor is 2D with shape [M, N], so each row has exactly N elements. So for each row, the number of elements is N. So, if we have a block size of N, then each block can process one row. But that might not be efficient for large N. However, Triton allows for dynamic block sizes, but perhaps it's better to use a fixed block size. Alternatively, maybe use a block size that is a multiple of N, but that's not necessary.

Alternatively, think of each thread as processing a single element in the row. Then, for a row m, the threads in the block would process elements from 0 to N-1. But how to arrange that. For example, the block can have multiple threads, each handling a different element in the row. Then, the block's shared memory can accumulate the sum for the row.

But how to handle the

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to calculate the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. Each row has N elements, and there are M rows. The mean for each row is the sum of the elements divided by N. So, the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M].

Now, considering the GPU operations. The kernel needs to process each row. For each row, I need to sum all the elements and then divide by N. But how to do this efficiently in Triton?

Let me think about the input and output. The input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. The output is a 1D tensor of size M. Each element in the output is the mean of the corresponding row.

In Triton, I'll need to process each row. So, for each row i, I need to sum all elements in column 0 to N-1. Then divide by N.

Memory layout: The input tensor is stored in row-major order. So, for a given row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j for j from 0 to N-1.

Now, the kernel needs to process each row. Let's think about the threads. Each thread can handle one row. So, the number of threads per block should be M, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, we can have each thread handle a single element in the row, but that would require more threads. Wait, but for summing, perhaps each thread can handle a portion of the row.

But since the row is of size N, maybe we can have each thread handle a single element. But that would require N threads per row. However, since M can be large, maybe we need to process rows in blocks. Alternatively, perhaps we can have each thread process a single element in the row, and then accumulate the sum.

But in Triton, the kernel is written in a way that each thread processes a specific element. So, for each row, the threads would process each element in that row. But that would require that each row is processed by multiple threads. However, if the kernel is designed to process rows, perhaps each thread is responsible for a row.

Wait, maybe the kernel is designed such that each thread processes a single row. So, for each row i, the thread computes the sum of that row, then divides by N.

But how to structure this. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The input tensor is a 2D tensor, and the output is a 1D tensor. The kernel needs to iterate over each row, sum the elements, then divide by N.

So, the steps for each thread:

1. For a given row i, compute the sum of all elements in that row.
2. Divide the sum by N to get the mean.

But how to do this in Triton. Let's think about the code structure.

The kernel will have a loop over the rows. Each thread is responsible for one row. So, the number of threads per block would be M, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, if M is large, we can have multiple threads per block, each handling a row.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows. So, for each row i, the thread processes that row.

So, the code would look something like:

@triton.jit
def kernel(...):
    i = ...  # row index
    sum_val = 0
    for j in range(N):
        sum_val += input[i * N + j]
    output[i] = sum_val / N

But wait, this would require that each thread processes all elements in the row. However, for large N, this would be inefficient. Because for each row, the thread has to iterate over all N elements. But maybe that's unavoidable.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a block size that allows for more efficient memory access. For example, if the block size is 128, then each thread can process a certain number of elements. But since the rows are of size N, perhaps it's better to have each thread handle a single element in the row. But that would require that each row is processed by N threads. However, with M rows, that could be a lot of threads.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows. So, perhaps the kernel is structured to have each thread handle a single row. Let me think about the parameters.

The input tensor is of shape [M, N], and the output is [M]. So, the kernel needs to process each row. So, the code would have a loop over the rows. For each row i, the thread would compute the sum of the row.

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the minimum value in each row of the tensor. Since the tensor is 2D, each row is of length N. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

So, the kernel needs to process each row. Let me consider how Triton works. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA, but with more flexibility. The kernel will be launched with a certain number of threads, and each thread will handle a specific element in the tensor.

The input tensor is of shape [M, N], so each row has N elements. The output is a vector of size M. Each thread should process one row, but wait, maybe not. Wait, if I have M rows, and each row has N elements, then for each row, I need to find the minimum. So, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single row. But how to structure that.

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. But that might not be efficient. Let me think about the block size. Let's say each block processes a row. So, each block handles one row, and the number of blocks is M. But how to structure the threads within the block. For example, if each block has N threads, then each thread can process one element in the row. But that's not efficient, because each row has N elements, and each thread would process one element. But for a row of N elements, the minimum can be found by comparing all elements. However, in Triton, it's more efficient to have each thread handle a portion of the data, but for a reduction, we need to do some kind of parallel reduction.

Wait, but the problem is to compute the minimum of each row. So, for each row, we need to find the minimum. So, for each row, we can have a reduction over the N elements. But how to do that in Triton.

Let me think about the approach. For each row, we can have a set of threads that process the elements of that row. Let's say that each block is responsible for one row. Then, the number of blocks is M. Each block has multiple threads, and each thread is responsible for a portion of the row. But for a reduction, the threads need to work together to find the minimum.

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then they perform a reduction. But that's not efficient, as each row would require N threads, which may not be optimal.

Wait, perhaps the optimal way is to have each block handle a row, and within the block, perform a reduction over the elements of the row. So, for each row, the block processes all N elements, and finds the minimum. But how to structure that.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensor is 2D, so each row is contiguous in memory. So, for a given row i, the elements are at positions i*N + 0, i*N + 1, ..., i*N + N-1.

In Triton, the kernel will be launched with a certain number of blocks. Each block will process one row. So, the number of blocks is M. Each block will have multiple threads. For each row, the threads in the block will process the elements of that row.

But how to structure the threads. For example, if each block has N threads, then each thread can process one element. But then, the threads need to perform a reduction. So, for each row, the threads will compare their elements and find the minimum. But how to do that.

Alternatively, maybe the block size is chosen such that each block can process a row efficiently. For example, if the block size is N, then each block has N threads, each handling one element. Then, the threads can perform a reduction to find the minimum.

But for a row of N elements, the number of threads per block is N. So, the block size is N. However, in Triton, the block size is usually a power of two. So, perhaps we can choose a block size that is a power of two, but that depends on N.

Alternatively, maybe the block size is set to a fixed value, say 256, and then each block processes a certain number of elements. But that may not be efficient for varying N.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed to process each row, and for each row, the threads in the block perform a reduction. So, for each row, the number of threads in the block is the number of elements in the row, and they perform a reduction.

But how

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the minimum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor). So for each row (each M element), I need to find the minimum of the N elements in that row.

Triton kernels work with threads, so I need to figure out how to partition the work. Since each row is independent, I can process each row in parallel. So the threads can be grouped by row. Each thread will handle one row.

The input tensor is [M, N], and the output will be a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Now, for the kernel parameters. The kernel needs to know the input tensor, the output tensor, the dimensions M and N. But in Triton, the kernel is written with the @triton.jit decorator, so I need to define the parameters in the decorator.

Next, the block size. Since each thread processes one row, the block size should be set to a number that allows each thread to handle one row. But how many threads per block? Well, the number of threads per block can be chosen based on the number of rows. For example, if there are M rows, then each block can process a certain number of rows. But since each thread is responsible for one row, maybe the block size is 1? Wait, no, because in Triton, the number of threads per block is determined by the block size. So if each thread is handling one row, then the block size would be set to 1, but that's not efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can have multiple threads per block, each handling a different row. Wait, no. Wait, the rows are independent, so each thread can handle a single row. So for each row, a thread is assigned to it. So the number of threads per block would be determined by how many rows are processed per block. But if M is large, then we need to have multiple blocks. But for the kernel, the threads are grouped into blocks, and each block processes a certain number of rows.

Wait, perhaps the kernel should be structured such that each thread handles one row. So the number of threads per block is equal to the number of rows that can be processed in parallel. But since each row is independent, maybe the block size is set to 1, but that's not efficient. Alternatively, perhaps the block size is set to a value that allows multiple rows to be processed in parallel. But that's not possible because each row is processed independently. Wait, no, because for each row, the thread needs to process all elements in that row. So each thread is responsible for one row. Therefore, the number of threads per block is determined by how many rows can be processed in a single block. But if the number of rows is large, then multiple blocks are needed. However, in Triton, the kernel is written with a block size, and the total number of threads is the number of blocks multiplied by the block size. So for example, if we have a block size of 1, then each block processes one row. But that would be inefficient because each block is only using one thread. Alternatively, if the block size is larger, like 1024, then each block can process 1024 rows, but that would require that the number of rows M is large enough. But in reality, each thread in the block would process a different row. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Let me think again. For each row i in 0 to M-1, we need to compute the minimum of the elements in that row. So for each row, the thread will process all N elements in that row. So the number of threads required is M, each handling one row. Therefore, the kernel should have M threads, each handling one row. But how to structure that in Triton.

In Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows. So for each row i, the thread processes that row. So the kernel would have a loop over i in 0..M-1, and for each i, the thread processes the elements in row i.

But how to structure this in Triton. The kernel is written with a loop over the rows. So the code would look something like:

@triton.jit
def kernel(...):
    i = ... # row index
    for j in range(N):
        ... # process element (i,j)

But how to compute the i for each thread. In Triton, the threads are grouped into blocks. So for each block, the threads are numbered from 0 to block_size-1. So for each block, we can compute the starting row

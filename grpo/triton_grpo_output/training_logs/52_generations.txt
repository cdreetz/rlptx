Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that subtracts two 1D tensors element-wise. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is straightforward: for each element in the input tensors, subtract the second tensor from the first. But since it's a Triton kernel, I need to make sure the memory access is efficient and the kernel is optimized for the GPU.

So, the input tensors are 1D, same size N. The output will also be 1D of size N. The kernel needs to process each element in parallel, right? Each thread will handle one element.

Now, considering Triton's memory model. The inputs are probably passed as pointers, and the output as another pointer. The kernel will need to load elements from the input tensors, subtract them, and store the result.

But how to handle the memory access? For each thread, I need to calculate the index in the input tensors. Let's say the input tensors are stored in global memory. Each thread will have a lane ID, which is the index of the element they're responsible for. So, for thread i, the index is i.

Wait, but in Triton, threads are grouped into warps, and each warp has a certain number of threads. So, the kernel should be designed so that each thread handles one element. The kernel's grid size would be determined by the number of elements N. For example, if N is 1024, then the grid is 1024 blocks, each with 1 thread. Or maybe a block with multiple threads, but since each element is processed by one thread, maybe it's better to have each thread handle one element.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written with a function that takes the input and output pointers, and the number of elements. The kernel is launched with a grid size that's determined by the number of elements. For example, if N is 1024, then the grid is 1024 blocks, each with 1 thread. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe using a block size that's a multiple of the warp size (32), but for this case, since each element is independent, maybe each thread handles one element. So the block size is 1, and the grid is N blocks.

But maybe that's not the most efficient way. However, for element-wise operations where each element is independent, it's acceptable. So the kernel would be written with a loop over the elements, each thread handling one.

So, the steps would be:

1. For each thread, calculate the index i = thread_idx.
2. Load input1[i] from global memory.
3. Load input2[i] from global memory.
4. Subtract input2[i] from input1[i].
5. Store the result in output[i].

But how to implement this in Triton? Let's think about the code structure.

The kernel function would be written with a loop over the elements. Each thread would have a unique index. So, the kernel would be something like:

@triton.jit
def kernel(input1, input2, output, N):
    pid = tl.program_id()
    i = pid
    # load input1[i]
    x = tl.load(input1 + i)
    y = tl.load(input2 + i)
    z = x - y
    tl.store(output + i, z)

But wait, in Triton, the input and output are passed as pointers, and the kernel is called with the number of elements. But the way the kernel is written, each thread handles one element. However, the problem is that for large N, this might not be efficient because each thread is doing a separate load and store. But for element-wise operations, this is acceptable.

But maybe there's a way to optimize by using shared memory. However, if the input and output tensors are already in global memory and the data is large, using shared memory might not be necessary. But for the sake of efficiency, perhaps using shared memory could help. However, in this case, since each element is independent, and the kernel is simple, maybe it's better to proceed with global memory access.

But wait, in Triton, the kernel is written in a way that each thread handles one element, and the code is written with the assumption that the data is in global memory. So, the code above would work.

But what about the memory access patterns? For each thread, accessing input1[i], input2[i], and output[i]. Since the data is in global memory, and each thread is accessing a unique index, the memory access is sequential. However, in Triton, the memory access is done via the pointer plus the index. So, for each thread, the code would be:

x = tl.load(input1 + i)
y = tl.load(input2 + i)
z = x - y
tl.store(output + i,

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that subtracts two 1D tensors element-wise. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is straightforward: for each element in the first tensor, subtract the corresponding element in the second tensor. But since it's a Triton kernel, I have to consider how to optimize memory access and parallelism.

So, the input tensors are 1D, same size N. The output will be another 1D tensor of size N. The kernel needs to process each element in parallel, but I should make sure that the memory access is efficient. Triton uses a grid and blocks structure, so I need to decide on the block size. Typically, for such operations, a block size of 256 is common, but maybe 128 or 512? Let's think about how many elements each thread can handle. If each thread processes one element, then the block size is irrelevant, but maybe using a larger block size could help with cache efficiency. Wait, but for element-wise operations, each thread usually handles one element. So maybe the block size is just a parameter, but the key is to make sure that each thread's memory access is coalesced.

Wait, in Triton, each thread in a block processes a single element. So for a 1D tensor, each thread would compute the index i = tid + blockIdx * blockDim. But since the tensors are 1D, the memory access is straightforward. However, for efficiency, I need to make sure that the memory accesses are coalesced. For example, if each thread accesses a different element, then the memory accesses are scattered, which is not efficient. But in this case, since each thread is handling one element, the memory accesses are sequential. Wait, no. If the threads are in the same block, they might have consecutive indices. For example, if the block size is 128, then threads 0-127 in the block would process elements 0-127, but that's only if the block is processing a single row. Wait, maybe I need to think about how the grid and blocks are arranged.

Wait, the kernel is for a 1D tensor. So the grid is determined by the number of elements. For example, if N is 1024, then the grid would have 1024 / 256 = 4 blocks. Each block processes 256 elements. But in this case, each thread would process one element. Wait, no. If the block size is 256, then each block has 256 threads. Each thread would compute its index as i = blockIdx * blockDim + threadIdx. So for each thread, it's handling one element. But that's not efficient because each thread is accessing a single element, which is scattered in memory. However, in Triton, the memory access is done via the index, so each thread would load the value from the input tensors at that index, subtract, and store to the output.

But for memory access, if the threads are processing consecutive elements, then the memory accesses would be coalesced. For example, if the block is processing elements 0-255, then each thread in the block would access elements 0-255, which are contiguous in memory. So the memory accesses would be coalesced. But if the block is processing elements that are not contiguous, then it's not. But in this case, the kernel is designed to process each element in order, so the threads in the same block would process consecutive elements.

So the key is to make sure that the index calculation is correct, and that each thread's access is to a single element. Then, the memory access is coalesced.

Now, the kernel parameters. The inputs are two tensors, A and B, and output C. Each thread will compute C[i] = A[i] - B[i].

So, the kernel would have:

- A and B as input tensors, with shape (N,)
- C as output tensor, shape (N,)

The kernel is written in Triton, so the @triton.jit decorator is needed. The parameters would include the input and output tensors, and the N.

But in Triton, the kernel needs to know the shape of the tensors. So the kernel would take the input tensors and the N, and then compute each element.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with the parameters as input, and the code is written to process each element.

So, the code would be something like:

@triton.jit
def kernel(A, B, C, N):
    pid = tl.program_id(axis=0)
    i = pid
    a = tl.load(A + i)
    b = tl.load(B + i)
    c = a - b
    tl.store(C + i, c)

But this is

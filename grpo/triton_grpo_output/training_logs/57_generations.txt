Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in Triton.

First, the inputs are A (M,K) and B (K,N), and the output is C (M,N). Each element C[i,j] is the sum of A[i,k] * B[k,j] for all k. But doing this naively would be too slow, so we need to use shared memory and tile-based computation.

In Triton, shared memory is used to store tiles of the matrices. The idea is to split the matrices into blocks (tiles) that fit into shared memory. For each block, we compute the product and accumulate the result.

Let me think about the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 is common. Let's say we choose 32 elements per thread. But I need to make sure that the threads can process the tiles correctly.

Each thread will handle a block of A and B. So for matrix A, each thread will load a block of size (block_size, block_size) into shared memory. Similarly for B. Then, the thread will compute the dot product between the corresponding rows of A and columns of B.

Wait, but in matrix multiplication, each thread in the grid would compute a block of the output matrix. So the threads are grouped into blocks, each responsible for a part of the output.

Wait, maybe I should structure the kernel such that each thread computes a block of the output. Let me think about the indices.

Let me consider that the kernel is for the output matrix C. Each thread is responsible for computing a single element of C. But that's not efficient. Instead, using tile-based computation, each thread block computes a block of C.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread block handles a tile of A and B, and computes the corresponding tile of C. But how to split the matrices into tiles.

Let me think of the matrices as being split into tiles of size (block_size, block_size). For example, if A is of size M x K, then each tile of A is block_size x block_size, and similarly for B.

But for matrix multiplication, the tiles of A and B would be multiplied, and the result is a tile of C. So each thread block would compute a tile of C.

But how to arrange the threads. Let me think of the grid as being divided into blocks, each block handling a tile of C. Each thread in the block would compute a part of the tile.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured with each thread handling a single element of C. But that would be the naive approach. To optimize, we need to use shared memory to store tiles of A and B.

So, the steps would be:

1. For each thread block, determine which tile of A and B it is responsible for.
2. Load the corresponding tiles of A and B into shared memory.
3. Compute the dot product between the tiles, accumulating the result into C.

But how to split the matrices into tiles. Let's say each tile is of size (block_size, block_size). So for matrix A (M x K), the number of tiles along rows is ceil(M / block_size), and along columns is ceil(K / block_size). Similarly for B (K x N).

But for matrix multiplication, the tiles of A and B must be compatible. So for each tile of A (size block_size x block_size) and tile of B (block_size x block_size), their product is a block of size block_size x block_size in C.

But how to map the threads to these tiles. Maybe each thread block is responsible for a tile of C. Then, each thread in the block computes a part of that tile.

Alternatively, each thread block handles a tile of A and a tile of B, and computes the corresponding tile of C.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look up the standard approach for Triton matrix multiplication.

In standard Triton matrix multiplication, the kernel is structured with each thread block handling a tile of C. The threads within the block compute the dot product between a row of A and a column of B. So, for each thread in the block, they compute a single element of C.

But with shared memory, the idea is to load a block of A and a block of B into shared memory, then compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to have each thread block compute a tile of C. Each thread in the block is responsible for computing a single element of C. However, to do this efficiently, the threads would load the corresponding rows of A and columns of B into shared memory, then compute the dot product.

But this would require that the threads in the

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by breaking down the problem.

First, matrix multiplication involves taking the dot product of rows from the first matrix and columns from the second matrix. The resulting matrix will have dimensions [M, N]. But since we're using shared memory, I need to figure out how to partition the data into tiles.

Triton kernels work with threads, so I should decide on a block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 is common. Let's go with 32 elements per thread, but maybe 128 for better utilization. Wait, the standard approach is to use a block size that allows for efficient memory access. For example, a block size of 16x16 or 32x32 might be good. But since we're using shared memory, the tile size should be chosen such that each thread can handle a small portion of the data.

The input tensors are A (M, K) and B (K, N). The output is C (M, N). Each element of C is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k. To compute this efficiently, we can tile the matrices into blocks of size, say, 32x32. Each thread block will handle a portion of the matrix.

For shared memory, each thread will load a tile of A and B into shared memory. Then, each thread computes a part of the dot product. But how to organize this?

Let me think about the memory layout. The first matrix A is of shape [M, K], and the second B is [K, N]. For each thread block, we can load a block of A and B into shared memory. Let's assume that the block size is 32x32. So, each thread in the block will handle a small portion of the matrix.

Wait, maybe I should use a block size that allows for multiple threads to work on different elements of the dot product. For example, in the standard matrix multiplication, each thread computes a single element of C. But with shared memory, we can do better by using tiles.

Alternatively, perhaps the block size is 128, and each thread handles a 4x4 tile. Wait, maybe I need to structure the kernel such that each thread block processes a block of rows from A and columns from B. Let me think about the standard approach.

In the standard Triton matrix multiplication, each thread block is responsible for computing a block of the output matrix. The block size is usually chosen to be 16x16 or 32x32. But for shared memory, the tiles need to be loaded into shared memory, and then the dot product is computed.

So, the steps would be:

1. Each thread block is responsible for computing a portion of the output matrix C. Let's say the block size is 16x16, so each thread block handles a 16x16 block of C.

2. The input matrices A and B are split into tiles. Each tile is of size (block_size, block_size). For example, if the block size is 16, then each tile is 16x16.

3. The threads in the block will load the corresponding tiles of A and B into shared memory.

4. Then, each thread computes the dot product between the corresponding row of A and column of B, but since the tiles are small, this can be done efficiently.

Wait, but for matrix multiplication, the actual computation is that each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, if we're using shared memory, each thread block would handle a block of rows from A and columns from B.

Alternatively, perhaps each thread block is responsible for computing a block of C. For example, if the block size is 16, then each thread block handles a 16x16 block of C. Then, each thread in the block would compute a single element of C.

But with shared memory, the idea is to load the tiles of A and B into shared memory, then compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B.

Wait, maybe the standard approach is to have each thread block compute a block of C. For example, if the block size is 16, then each thread block handles a 16x16 block of C. Then, each thread in the block would compute a single element of C. But that's the same as the standard approach without shared memory. However, with shared memory, we can load the tiles of A and B into shared memory, then compute the dot product.

But how to structure

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first matrix is MxK, the second is KxN, so the result should be MxN. Each element in the output is the sum of products of elements from the rows of the first matrix and columns of the second matrix.

Now, considering how Triton works, I need to structure the kernel to handle this efficiently. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA, but with more abstraction. The key is to use the triton.language module, which provides primitives for memory access and operations.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors are stored in row-major order, which is the default in most frameworks. So for the first matrix A (MxK), each row is stored contiguously. Similarly, the second matrix B (KxN) has each row contiguous. The output matrix C (MxN) will be stored in the same way.

In Triton, each thread is responsible for computing one element of the output matrix. But since matrix multiplication can be computationally intensive, we need to optimize the kernel by using shared memory and proper tiling. However, since the user hasn't specified using shared memory, maybe I should proceed with the standard approach, assuming that the matrices are large enough that we can't fit them all in shared memory. Alternatively, maybe the kernel can be written without shared memory, but that might not be efficient. Wait, but for Triton, using shared memory is usually better for performance. But the user hasn't mentioned that, so perhaps I should proceed with the standard approach, but maybe I need to use tiling.

Wait, but the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton would involve using shared memory. Let me recall: for each thread, we can load a block of elements from A and B into shared memory, then compute the dot product. But the exact block size depends on the problem.

Alternatively, if the matrices are too large, we can't fit them into shared memory. So perhaps the kernel should be written with a block size that allows for tiling. Let me think about the block size. For example, if each thread block processes a certain number of rows and columns, but that's more for the case when the matrices are too big for shared memory.

Wait, maybe the user just wants a simple kernel that computes each element of the output matrix by multiplying the corresponding elements of the rows of A and columns of B, then summing them. But that would be O(M*K*N) operations, which is not efficient. So the correct approach is to use shared memory to store a tile of A and B, and compute the dot product in a more efficient way.

But the user hasn't specified any constraints on the matrix size. So perhaps I should proceed with the standard approach for matrix multiplication using shared memory. Let me outline the steps.

First, the kernel will have to process each element of the output matrix C. For each element C[i][j], it's the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So each thread is responsible for computing one element of C.

But if I do this naively, each thread would have to iterate over all K elements, which is O(K) per element. That's not efficient. So the better approach is to use shared memory to store a block of A and B, and compute the dot product in a way that uses the shared memory.

So, the steps would be:

1. Each thread block handles a block of rows from A and columns from B. For example, each thread block could process a block of size (block_size, block_size) in the A and B matrices. But I need to figure out the block size.

Wait, maybe I should use a block size of 16, which is a common choice for Triton kernels. Let me think about the block size. The block size is usually chosen to be a power of two, and it's often 16, 32, 64, etc. For matrix multiplication, the block size is often set to 16, which allows for efficient tiling.

So, for each thread in the block, we can compute a portion of the dot product. For example, if the block size is 16, then each thread would handle 16 elements in the K dimension. But how does that work?

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is written in a way that each thread computes one element of the output matrix, but uses shared memory to store the necessary elements of A and B. But that's not efficient for large K.

Alternatively, the kernel could be written using the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton, which uses shared memory. Let me recall the standard approach.

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to compute C = A * B, where A is MxK and B is KxN. The resulting matrix C should be MxN. Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

In Triton, I need to structure the kernel to handle this efficiently. Let me recall how Triton works. The kernel is written in a way that each thread handles a portion of the computation. The key is to partition the problem into blocks that can be processed in parallel.

For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to compute a portion of the result. The standard approach is to have each thread compute a block of the result, but since the matrices are of size MxK and KxN, I need to think about how to split them into tiles.

Let me consider the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. For each thread, I need to compute the dot product between a row of A and a column of B. However, since K can be large, it's better to process in blocks. So, I'll need to split the matrices into blocks of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), where BLOCK_SIZE is a parameter I can choose.

Wait, the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to use a block size that allows each thread to compute a tile of the result. For example, if the block size is 32, each thread might handle a 32x32 tile of the result. But in this case, since the matrices are MxK and KxN, the block size needs to be chosen such that the threads can process the necessary elements.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let me think: for each element C[i][j], the computation is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, for each thread, I need to compute a single element of C. But if K is large, this would be slow. Therefore, it's better to process multiple elements in parallel.

Wait, but in Triton, each thread can handle a single element. However, if K is large, then each thread would have to perform many operations. So, perhaps using a block size that allows each thread to process a block of K elements. But how?

Alternatively, maybe I should use a more efficient approach where each thread computes a block of the result. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread computes a 32x32 block of the result. But that would require that the matrices are split into tiles of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), and the threads compute the dot product between a row of A and a column of B.

But in this case, the matrices A and B are of size MxK and KxN. So, the block size for the rows of A and columns of B would need to be chosen such that they fit into the block size. Let me think about how to structure the kernel.

Let me recall that in the standard matrix multiplication Triton kernel, the kernel is structured with two loops: one for the rows of A and one for the columns of B. Each thread computes a single element of C by summing over the common index k. However, this approach can be slow for large K, as each thread would have to perform K operations. To optimize, we can use a block size that allows each thread to process multiple elements in parallel.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. So, for A, each row is contiguous in memory. For B, each column is contiguous. So, for each element C[i][j], the thread needs to access A[i][k] and B[k][j] for all k.

But to compute this efficiently, we can use a block size that allows each thread to process a block of K elements. However, this would require that the block size is chosen such that the threads can process multiple k's. But how?

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element of C. However, if K is large, then each thread would have to perform K operations. To optimize, we can use a block size that allows each thread to process multiple elements in parallel. But how?

Alternatively, maybe I should split the matrices into tiles. Let me think of the matrices as being split into tiles of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). Then, each thread computes a block of the result. However, this would require that the matrices are split into tiles, and the threads compute the dot product between

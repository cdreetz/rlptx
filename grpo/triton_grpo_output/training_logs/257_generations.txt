Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum each column of the matrix. So for each column (which is the last dimension), I need to add up all the elements in that column. Since it's a 2D tensor, the input is M rows and N columns. The output should be a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the sum of the corresponding column.

Next, input and output tensor shapes. The input is [M, N], and the output is [M]. The memory layout is probably row-major, so each row is contiguous in memory. For a 2D tensor, the elements are stored as [0, 0], [0, 1], ..., [0, N-1], [1, 0], etc.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels use threads per block. For a sum reduction, a common approach is to have each thread handle a single element, but since we're summing along the column, maybe we can have each thread process a single element in the column. However, for efficiency, maybe we can have each block handle a portion of the columns. Wait, but since we're summing along the last dimension (columns), perhaps each thread should process a single element in the column. But with M rows and N columns, if N is large, maybe we need to process multiple elements per thread. Wait, no. Wait, the sum is along the last dimension, which is N. So each column is of length M. So for each column, we need to sum M elements. So for each column, the threads can process each element in that column.

But how to structure the threads. Let me think: for each column, we can have multiple threads working on that column. But since the columns are independent, maybe each thread can handle a single element in a column. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread handle a single element in the column, and then accumulate the sum.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. So perhaps the kernel will have a loop over the columns, and for each column, loop over the rows. Wait, but the sum is along the last dimension (columns), so for each column, we need to sum all the elements in that column. So for each column j, sum over i from 0 to M-1 of A[i][j].

But how to structure the threads. Let's think about the grid and blocks. Let's say we have a grid of blocks, each block handles a certain number of columns. For example, if there are N columns, each block could handle a certain number of columns. But since each column has M elements, the threads in the block would process the elements in that column.

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the column. But that would require that each thread processes one element, and then accumulate the sum. But with M elements per column, that would require M threads per column. But if M is large, that's not efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can use a reduction approach where each thread processes multiple elements.

Wait, but the problem is that the sum is along the last dimension. So for each column, we need to sum all elements in that column. So perhaps the kernel should process each column, and for each column, sum all the elements in that column.

So the approach could be:

- The kernel is divided into blocks, each block handles a certain number of columns. For example, if there are N columns, each block handles a certain number of columns (say, BLOCK_SIZE), and for each column in that block, the threads process the elements in that column.

But how to structure the threads. Let me think about the parameters. The kernel needs to process each column. For each column, we need to sum all M elements. So for each column j, the sum is sum_{i=0}^{M-1} A[i][j].

So for each column j, the threads can be arranged to process each element in that column. But how to do that in Triton.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured with each thread handling a single element in the column. Then, for each column, all threads in the block process that element. But that might not be efficient.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured with each thread processing a single element in the column, and then the threads in the block perform a reduction to sum them. But that would require that each thread is responsible for a single element, and then the block reduces the sum.

But for that, the kernel would need to process each element in the column, and then the block reduces the sum. But how to do that.

Alternatively, maybe the

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum each column of the tensor. So for each column (which is along the N dimension), we need to add up all the elements in that column. Since it's a 2D tensor, the last dimension is N, so each row is M elements, and there are N columns.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The input is [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of size N, where each element is the sum of the corresponding column. So for each column j in 0..N-1, sum over i=0..M-1 of input[i][j].

Memory layout: The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous. For a 2D tensor, the elements are arranged as [0, 1, 2, ..., M-1, M, M+1, ... 2M-1, ...]. So for column j, the elements are at positions j, j + M, j + 2M, etc.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels use blocks that process elements in chunks. For a sum reduction, we can process each column in a block. But since each column has M elements, the block size should be such that each thread can handle a chunk of elements in the column. However, since the sum is along the entire column, maybe each thread can handle a portion of the column. Alternatively, since the column is M elements, maybe we can have each thread process one element, but that might not be efficient. Wait, but if M is large, having each thread process one element would be okay, but maybe we can have threads process multiple elements. However, since the sum is over the entire column, perhaps it's better to have each thread process a single element and accumulate. But that's not efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread handle a chunk of elements, but since the column is M elements, perhaps the block size is set to M, but that depends on the actual M. But since M can vary, we need to make the block size dynamic. Wait, but in Triton, the block size is fixed per kernel. So perhaps we need to choose a block size that can handle the elements in the column. Alternatively, maybe we can use a block size that's a multiple of the number of elements per column. But perhaps the best approach is to have each thread process one element in the column, and then accumulate the sum. But that would require a reduction across threads in the warp. Wait, but if each thread is responsible for a single element, then the sum for the column would be the sum of all the elements in that column. So for each column, we have multiple threads, each taking one element, and then we need to reduce them across the threads. But how to structure that.

Alternatively, since the column is M elements, maybe we can have each thread handle a chunk of elements. For example, if the block size is 128, then each thread can process a certain number of elements. But this depends on how M is structured. However, given that M can be any size, perhaps the best approach is to have each thread process a single element in the column, and then perform a reduction across the threads in the block. But that would require that each thread's work is to add their element to the sum. However, in that case, the block would have multiple threads, each contributing one element, and then the block's sum is the total for the column.

But how to structure this. Let me think about the kernel structure.

The kernel needs to process each column. So for each column j in 0..N-1, we need to sum all elements in that column. So the kernel should iterate over each column, and for each column, sum all elements in that column.

But how to do that in Triton. The kernel will have a loop over the columns. For each column, the threads in the block will process elements in that column.

But the problem is that the number of elements per column is M. So for each column, the number of elements is M. So if the block size is set to 128, then each block can handle up to 128 elements. But if M is larger than 128, then multiple blocks would be needed. But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the columns, and for each column, the threads process elements in that column.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured as follows:

- The kernel is launched with grid size (N, 1), since there are N columns. Each block processes one column.

- For each column j,

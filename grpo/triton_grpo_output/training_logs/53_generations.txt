Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to compute the mean of each row. Since it's a 2D tensor, each row is of length N. So for each row (i.e., each row index M), I need to sum all elements in that row and then divide by N. But wait, the problem says "mean reduction along the last dimension", which for a 2D tensor would be along the N dimension. So each row's mean is the sum of its elements divided by N.

So the kernel needs to process each row. Let me consider the input tensor as [M, N], and the output should be [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

Now, input and output shapes. The input is M rows, each with N elements. The output is M elements. The output tensor will have shape [M].

Next, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels typically use a grid of blocks, each processing a certain number of elements. For this problem, each block can handle a single row. But wait, if each block processes one row, then the number of blocks would be M. But for large M, this could be inefficient. Alternatively, maybe each block processes multiple rows, but that depends on how the data is laid out.

Wait, the input tensor is [M, N], so each row is contiguous in memory. So for each row i, the elements are at positions i*N to i*N + N-1. So for each row, the kernel needs to sum all elements in that row.

But how to structure the kernel. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The input tensor is a 2D tensor, and the output is a 1D tensor. The kernel will need to process each row. So perhaps each thread processes a single element in a row, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, each thread could process a single element, but for each row, we need to accumulate the sum.

Wait, but for each row, we can have multiple threads working on that row. For example, if we have a block size of 32, then each block can handle a row by having 32 threads, each processing a single element in that row. But that would require that each thread knows which row it's processing. Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in a row, and the block is responsible for a single row.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each block processes a single row. Let me think about how to structure the kernel.

The kernel should have a grid of blocks, each block processing a single row. So for each row i, we have a block that computes the sum of that row. Then, the output is the sum divided by N.

So, the kernel would take the input tensor, and for each row i, sum all elements in that row, then divide by N. The output is a 1D tensor of size M.

So, the kernel parameters would be:

- input: a 2D tensor of shape [M, N]
- output: a 1D tensor of shape [M]
- N: the number of elements per row (the second dimension of the input)
- M: the number of rows (the first dimension of the input)

But in Triton, the kernel needs to be written with parameters that can be passed in. So the kernel would have to take the input and output tensors, and the dimensions M and N. But how to handle that in Triton?

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is written such that each thread processes a single element in a row, and the block is responsible for a single row. So, the kernel's grid is M blocks, each handling one row. Each block has multiple threads, each processing a single element in that row.

But for that, the kernel would need to know the row index. Let me think about the kernel's code.

The kernel would have a loop over the rows. For each row, the threads in the block process each element in that row. So, for each row i, the block's threads process elements from i*N to i*N + N-1. But how to structure that.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured with each thread handling a single element in a row, and the block is responsible for a row. So, the block's index is the row index. Then, each thread in the block processes a single element in that row. But that would require that the block's index is the row index, and each thread in the block processes a single element in that row.

But how to handle that. Let's think about the code.

First, the kernel is written with the @triton.jit decorator. The parameters would be the input tensor, output

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to compute the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. So for each row (each M element), I need to sum all the elements in that row and then divide by N. Since it's a mean, I need to handle the division properly, but since Triton is in the Triton library, I should use the appropriate operations.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

Now, considering the memory layout. The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. The output tensor will be a 1D array where each element corresponds to a row's mean.

For the kernel, I need to decide on block sizes and memory access patterns. Since we're processing rows, each block can handle a certain number of rows. Let's think about the block size. A common approach is to use a block size that's a power of two, like 256. But since each row has N elements, the number of elements per row can vary. However, since N is fixed for the tensor, each block can process multiple rows, but each row's elements need to be summed.

Wait, but the kernel is for a 2D tensor. So each thread should process a single row. Wait, but if the block size is 256, then each block can handle multiple rows. Wait, no. Let me think again. For each row, we need to sum all N elements. So each thread can handle a single row. But if the number of rows (M) is large, then we need to have multiple threads per block. Alternatively, maybe each thread processes a single element in a row. But that would be inefficient. Alternatively, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single row, and then the block computes the sum for that row.

Wait, but for a 2D tensor, each row has N elements. So if each thread is responsible for a single row, then each thread would need to load all N elements of that row, sum them, and then divide by N. But how to do that efficiently.

Alternatively, maybe we can process each row in a way that each thread processes a single element in the row. But that would require more threads. Let me think about the kernel structure.

Let me consider the kernel parameters. The input tensor is of shape [M, N], and the output is [M]. So for each row i in 0..M-1, we need to compute sum of input[i, 0..N-1] / N.

So, for each row, we need to sum N elements. The kernel can be structured such that each thread is responsible for a single row. But if the number of rows is large, then we need to have multiple threads per block. However, in Triton, each thread in a block can process a different row. So the block size can be set to a value that allows for multiple threads per block, each handling a row.

But wait, the problem is that for each row, we need to process N elements. So if each thread is responsible for a single row, then each thread needs to process N elements. So the number of threads per block would be M, but that's not feasible if M is large. Alternatively, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. But that would require more threads.

Alternatively, maybe we can process each row in a way that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. But that would require more threads. However, for a 2D tensor, each row is contiguous, so perhaps we can process each row in a way that each thread processes a single element. But that's not efficient.

Wait, perhaps the kernel can be structured as follows: each thread is responsible for a single row. Then, for that row, the thread needs to sum all the elements. But how to do that efficiently. For example, if the row has N elements, then the thread would need to load each element and add them up. However, this would require that each thread has access to all the elements of the row. But with a block size of, say, 256, each block can handle up to 256 rows. But if each row has N elements, then each thread would need to process N elements. That could be a problem for memory access.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread processes a single element in the row. Then, for each row, all the elements are processed by different threads. But this would require

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The user wants tile-based computation using shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in Triton.

First, the inputs are A (M x K) and B (K x N). The output is C (M x N), where each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k. But since we're using shared memory, we'll need to break this into tiles. 

Triton kernels typically use blocks that process a portion of the matrix. For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that allows for efficient memory access. The block size is often chosen based on the number of elements that can be stored in shared memory. Let's think about the block size. 

In the standard approach, each block processes a tile of size (block_size, block_size). For example, if the block size is 32, each block handles a 32x32 tile. But since we're dealing with two matrices, A and B, the block size might need to be adjusted based on how we load data into shared memory.

Wait, the problem mentions tile-based computation with shared memory. So, the idea is to load a tile of A and a tile of B into shared memory, multiply them, and then accumulate the result into C. But how to structure this in Triton?

Let me think about the steps. For each block, we'll process a portion of the matrix. Let's say each block handles a tile of size (tile_size, tile_size). The tile_size should be chosen such that the shared memory can hold the tiles. But what's the optimal tile size? Typically, it's a power of two, like 32 or 64. Let's go with 32 for now.

So, for matrix multiplication, each block will handle a certain number of rows and columns. The key is to load the corresponding tiles of A and B into shared memory, then perform the multiplication, and accumulate the result into C.

But how to map the threads into this structure. Let's consider that each thread in the block handles a single element of the tile. Wait, no. In matrix multiplication, each thread might handle a single element of the result, but that's not efficient. Instead, each thread might handle a single element of the tile, but that's not correct. Wait, no. The standard approach is that each thread in the block handles a single element of the result. But that's not efficient. Instead, the block processes a tile of A and B, and each thread computes a part of the product.

Alternatively, in the standard approach, each block handles a tile of A (size block_m x block_k) and a tile of B (size block_k x block_n), and each thread in the block computes a part of the product. But I need to think about the exact structure.

Let me recall that in Triton, each thread is responsible for a single element of the output. But with shared memory, we can load a tile of A and B into shared memory, and then compute the product for that tile.

Wait, perhaps the block is responsible for a certain number of rows in A and columns in B. For example, each block handles a tile of A (say, block_m rows) and a tile of B (block_k columns). But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, the block is responsible for a certain number of rows in A and columns in B. Let's think of the block as processing a tile of A (rows i to i + block_m -1, columns 0 to K-1) and a tile of B (rows 0 to K-1, columns j to j + block_n -1). Then, each thread in the block would compute the product for a particular element in the result.

But I think the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton uses a block that processes a tile of A and B. Let me think about the parameters.

The kernel needs to take the input tensors A and B, and output tensor C. The shapes are (M, K) for A and (K, N) for B. The output is (M, N).

In Triton, each thread is responsible for a single element of the output. But to make this efficient, we need to load tiles of A and B into shared memory. The block size is typically chosen based on the number of elements that can be stored in shared memory. For example, if the block size is 32, then each block can handle a tile of size 32x32.

Wait, but in matrix multiplication, the block size is usually determined by the number of elements that can be processed in parallel. For example, each block might handle a tile of size (block_m,

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in Triton.

First, the input tensors are A (M x K) and B (K x N). The result is C (M x N), where each element C[i,j] is the dot product of the i-th row of A and the j-th column of B. But doing this naively would be slow, so we need to optimize with shared memory and tiling.

Tiling involves dividing the matrices into smaller blocks (tiles) that fit into shared memory. For each tile, we load the corresponding rows of A and columns of B into shared memory, compute the dot product, and store the result in C.

So, the steps would be:

1. Determine the tile size. Let's say each tile is of size TILE_M x TILE_K for matrix A and TILE_K x TILE_N for matrix B. But since A is M x K and B is K x N, maybe the tile size for A is TILE_M x TILE_K and for B is TILE_K x TILE_N. Wait, but in matrix multiplication, each tile of A is multiplied with a tile of B. So, the tiles for A and B should be such that their dimensions align for the dot product.

Wait, the standard approach is to split the matrices into tiles. For example, for each tile of A (size TILE_M x TILE_K) and each tile of B (size TILE_K x TILE_N), the multiplication would be done in shared memory. But since K is the dimension that's being multiplied, perhaps the tile size for A is TILE_M x TILE_K and for B is TILE_K x TILE_N. Then, for each tile, we compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B.

But how to structure the kernel? The kernel needs to handle each element of C. However, with tiling, we can process multiple elements at once.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in global memory. The kernel will load parts of A and B into shared memory. For each block of threads, they will compute a block of C.

But how to split the problem into tiles. Let's assume that the kernel is responsible for computing a block of C, say, from row i to i + TILE_M - 1 and column j to j + TILE_N - 1. But since the matrices are M x K and K x N, the tiles for A and B would be TILE_M x TILE_K and TILE_K x TILE_N respectively.

Wait, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread block handles a tile of C. But given that Triton is a per-thread approach, maybe each thread is responsible for computing a single element of C. However, with tiling, we can have threads compute multiple elements in a block.

Alternatively, the kernel could be designed such that each thread block computes a block of C, but that's more complex. Let's think of the standard approach for matrix multiplication with Triton.

In the standard approach, each thread computes a single element of C. But with tiling, we can load a tile of A and a tile of B into shared memory, compute the dot product for each element in the tile, and then store the result.

But how to structure the threads. Let's say that each thread is responsible for computing one element of C. However, with tiling, each thread block would handle a tile of A and a tile of B.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured with threads that compute a block of C. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look up the standard Triton matrix multiplication example.

In the standard Triton matrix multiplication, each thread computes a single element of C. The kernel is divided into blocks, and each block handles a certain region of the matrix. The shared memory is used to load the relevant rows of A and columns of B.

Wait, here's a possible approach:

- The kernel is divided into blocks of threads. Each block handles a tile of C. For example, each block is responsible for computing a tile of C of size TILE_M x TILE_N. However, since the matrices are M x K and K x N, the tiles for A and B would be TILE_M x TILE_K and TILE_K x TILE_N respectively. But that's not directly applicable.

Alternatively, the kernel is designed such that each thread computes a single element of C. The shared memory is used to load the relevant rows of A and columns of B. For example, each thread loads a row of A into shared memory, and a column of B into shared memory, then computes the dot product.

But that's not efficient. Instead, we can use tiling where each thread block loads a tile of A and a tile of B into shared memory,

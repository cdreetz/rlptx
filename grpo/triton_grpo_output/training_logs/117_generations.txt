Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, matrix multiplication between a MxK matrix and a KxN matrix results in a MxN matrix. Each element in the output is the sum of the products of elements from the corresponding row of the first matrix and column of the second matrix. So, for each element (i, j) in the output, it's the sum over k from 0 to K-1 of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

Now, considering Triton's capabilities. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a high-level, yet efficient manner. The kernel needs to be optimized for performance, so I need to think about how to structure the loops, memory access patterns, and block sizes.

Let me think about the input tensors. The first tensor is A with shape [M, K], and the second is B with shape [K, N]. The output tensor C will be [M, N]. Each element in C is computed as the dot product of the i-th row of A and the j-th column of B.

In Triton, each thread can handle a block of elements. The key is to partition the problem into blocks that can be processed in parallel. For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to compute a portion of the result. However, since K can be large, we need to choose a block size that allows for efficient memory access and reduces the number of transactions.

Let me consider the block size. A common choice is to use a block size of 128, which is a power of two and allows for efficient memory access. But I need to think about how the threads are arranged. Each thread can compute a portion of the result. For example, each thread could compute a single element of the output matrix. However, that might not be efficient because it would require many memory accesses.

Alternatively, using a block size that allows each thread to compute multiple elements. But maybe for simplicity, start with each thread computing a single element. However, that might not be optimal. Let me think about the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton.

In standard matrix multiplication, each thread is responsible for computing one element of the output. The threads are arranged in a grid where each thread is responsible for a particular (i, j) in the output. However, this approach can be slow because each thread has to perform K loads and multiplies. To optimize, we can use a block size that allows each thread to process multiple elements, but that might complicate the code.

Alternatively, use a block size that allows for efficient memory access. For example, using a block size of 128, and each thread computes a portion of the result. But how?

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element. Let me think about the memory access. For each element C[i][j], the thread needs to access A[i][k] and B[k][j] for all k. So, for each k, the thread would load A[i][k], multiply by B[k][j], and accumulate the sum.

But in Triton, each thread is a warp, and each warp can have multiple threads. However, in this case, the threads are arranged in a grid where each thread is responsible for a specific (i, j) in the output. So, the grid is M x N, and each thread computes one element.

But that's not efficient because for each element, the thread has to do K operations. So, for K=1000, that's a lot of operations. To optimize, we can use a block size that allows for more efficient memory access. For example, using a block size that allows each thread to compute multiple elements, but that's more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a block size that allows each thread to compute a portion of the result. For example, using a block size of 128, and each thread computes a certain number of elements. However, that might require more complex indexing.

Alternatively, think about the problem in terms of the threads being responsible for a certain range of K. For example, each thread computes a portion of the K dimension. But that's more complex.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to use a block size of 128, and each thread is responsible for a single element of the output. So, the grid is M x N, and each thread is responsible for (i, j). Then, for each (i, j), the thread loops over k from 0 to K-1, multiplying A[i][k] and B[k][j], and accumulating the sum.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a grid and a block. The grid is determined by the number of elements

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first matrix is MxK and the second is KxN, so the result should be MxN. Each element in the output is the sum of the products of elements from the rows of the first matrix and columns of the second matrix.

In Triton, I need to handle the computation in a way that's efficient on the GPU. The key is to structure the kernel to compute each element of the output matrix correctly, using proper memory access patterns to minimize latency and maximize throughput.

Let me recall how matrix multiplication is done in Triton. Typically, each thread block handles a block of the output matrix. For each element in the output, the thread computes the sum over the K elements. But since K can be large, it's better to have each thread handle a portion of the K dimension. However, for a standard approach, each thread might compute one element of the output, but that could be inefficient if K is large. Alternatively, using a block size that allows each thread to compute multiple elements, but that might complicate things.

Wait, the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to have each thread block compute a block of the output matrix. For example, each block handles a submatrix of size (block_size, block_size), and each thread within the block computes one element of the output. But that's for when the matrices are large enough. However, in this case, the matrices are MxK and KxN. So the output is MxN.

But for the kernel, I need to think about how to structure the threads. Let's consider that each thread computes one element of the output matrix. So for each element (i, j) in the output, the thread would compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But how to map this to the threads? Each thread would have a unique i and j. However, for large matrices, this might not be efficient. But given that Triton is designed for this, perhaps it's manageable.

So the steps are:

1. Determine the input and output tensors. The first input is A with shape [M, K], the second is B with shape [K, N], and the output is C with shape [M, N].

2. The kernel needs to compute each element of C as the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

3. The kernel should be written with the @triton.jit decorator, and the parameters should include the input and output tensors, along with their shapes.

4. The kernel should handle the indices i and j for the output matrix. Each thread is responsible for computing one element of C.

But how to structure the loop over k? For each thread, we need to iterate over k from 0 to K-1, multiply A[i][k] and B[k][j], and accumulate the sum.

But with Triton, the threads are organized into blocks. So, the kernel needs to have a way to compute the correct i and j for each thread. Let's think about the thread indices.

In Triton, each thread has a unique index within the block. So, for the output matrix C, each thread can be responsible for a specific (i, j) pair. However, since the output is MxN, the number of threads needed would be M*N. But if M and N are large, this could be a lot of threads, but Triton can handle that.

But how to map the thread index to the i and j? Let's say that each thread is responsible for a specific (i, j) pair. So, the thread index within the block can be used to compute i and j. However, this might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is designed to process each row of the output matrix, with each thread block handling a row.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread block handles a row of the output matrix. For example, each block handles a single row i of the output, and each thread in the block handles a column j of that row. But that would require that the block size is compatible with the number of columns N.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again. For matrix multiplication, the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element of the output. So, for each element C[i][j], the thread computes the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

So, the kernel would have to iterate over i and j for each element. However, in Triton, the kernel is written with the thread indices, and the code is structured in a way that each thread computes a specific element.

But how to handle the i and j? Let

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first matrix is MxK, the second is KxN, so the result should be MxN. Each element in the result is the sum of the products of elements from the rows of the first matrix and columns of the second matrix.

In Triton, I need to handle the computation efficiently. Let me recall how Triton works. The kernel is divided into blocks, each processing a certain number of elements. The key is to choose block sizes that maximize parallelism and memory coalescing.

For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to handle a submatrix. Let's think about the dimensions. The first matrix has M rows and K columns, the second has K rows and N columns. The result is M rows and N columns.

In Triton, each thread block will process a certain number of rows and columns. Let me decide on the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, people use a block size of (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), but maybe here it's better to split the problem into rows and columns. Wait, maybe the block size should be such that each thread handles a certain number of elements in the row of the first matrix and column of the second matrix.

Alternatively, think about the indices. For each element (i, j) in the result, we need to compute sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, each thread can be responsible for a particular i and j, but that's not efficient because it would require a lot of threads. Instead, we can have each thread block handle a block of rows and columns.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread block handle a block of K elements. Let me think: the first matrix is MxK, so for each row i in the first matrix, we have K elements. The second matrix is KxN, so for each column j in the second matrix, we have K elements. So, for each thread block, maybe we can process a block of rows from the first matrix and a block of columns from the second matrix.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let me recall that in Triton, each thread is responsible for a certain element in the result. Wait, no. In matrix multiplication, the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element of the result. But that's not efficient because each element requires K operations. So, to optimize, we can use a block size that allows each thread block to compute multiple elements in parallel.

Alternatively, perhaps the block size is chosen such that each thread block handles a block of rows from the first matrix and a block of columns from the second matrix. For example, if the block size is 16, then each thread block handles 16 rows of the first matrix and 16 columns of the second matrix. But I need to think about how to structure the indices.

Wait, maybe the standard approach for Triton is to have each thread block handle a certain number of rows and columns. Let me look up the standard Triton matrix multiplication approach. Oh right, the standard approach is to have each thread block process a block of rows from the first matrix and a block of columns from the second matrix. For example, if the block size is 16, then each thread block handles 16 rows of the first matrix and 16 columns of the second matrix. However, this might not be the case here. Alternatively, perhaps each thread block is responsible for a certain number of elements in the result matrix.

Alternatively, perhaps the block size is determined by the number of elements that can be processed per thread. For example, if the block size is 16, then each thread block has 16 threads, and each thread handles a certain number of elements. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of elements that can be processed per thread.

But perhaps I should think about the dimensions. Let me think of the first matrix as A with shape (M, K), and the second as B with shape (K, N). The result is C with shape (M, N). Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

In Triton, each thread will compute one element of C. However, that would require K operations per element. To optimize, we can have each thread block process multiple elements of C. But how?

Alternatively, the standard approach is to have each thread block process a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. For example, if the block size is 16, then each thread block handles 16 rows of A and 16 columns of B. Then, each

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first tensor is MxK, the second is KxN, so the result should be MxN. Each element in the output is the sum of the product of elements from the first row and second column, for each k in 0 to K-1.

In Triton, I need to structure the kernel to handle this efficiently. Let's recall how Triton works. The kernel is written in a way that uses threads to process elements. Each thread might handle a part of the computation.

So, the main steps are:

1. Determine the dimensions: M (rows of first matrix), K (columns of first and rows of second), N (columns of second matrix).
2. Each thread will compute one element of the output matrix. But how to split the work? Since K can be large, maybe we need to loop over K for each thread. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe use a block size that allows for efficient computation.

Wait, in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the problem size. For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to have each thread compute a single element of the output. But that's not efficient for large K. So perhaps we need to use a block size that allows for multiple elements to be computed in parallel.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a more efficient approach where each thread computes multiple elements, but that depends on the problem size. Let me think.

In the standard matrix multiplication, each element in the output is computed as the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So for each i and j, we need to compute this sum.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the problem size. Let's think about the dimensions. Let me assume that the kernel is written for a specific i and j, and then loop over k. But that might not be efficient if K is large.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a block size that allows for multiple k's to be processed. For example, if the block size is 16, then each thread can process 16 elements of k. But that would require that K is a multiple of the block size. But perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread handles one element of the output. So, for each i and j, the thread computes the sum over k. But that would require that each thread is responsible for a single (i,j) pair. However, that's not feasible if the number of threads is too large. So perhaps the kernel is structured with a loop over i, j, and k.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the problem size. So maybe the kernel is structured as follows:

- The kernel is divided into blocks, each block handles a certain range of i and j. But that might be complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is written with a loop over the K dimension. Let me think about the code structure.

The kernel will have a loop over the K dimension. For each k, we load A[i][k] and B[k][j], multiply them, and accumulate the sum.

But how to structure the threads. Let's consider that each thread is responsible for a particular i and j. But that would require that the threads are arranged in a way that each thread handles one (i,j) pair. However, that's not efficient for large K. So maybe the kernel is structured with a loop over K, and each thread computes a single element of the sum.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is written with a loop over the K dimension, and each thread computes a single element of the sum. So, for each thread, we have i, j, and k. But that's not possible because the thread index would need to be mapped to i and j.

Wait, perhaps the kernel is structured with a loop over the K dimension, and each thread is responsible for a single k. But that's not the case. Let me think again.

In standard matrix multiplication, each element in the output is computed as the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, for each i and j, we need to loop over k. So, the kernel would need to handle this for each i and j. But how to map this to threads.

In Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the problem size. So, perhaps the kernel is structured with a loop over i, then j, then k. But that's not efficient for large K.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured with a loop over k, and for each k, compute the product of A[i][k] and B[k][j], and accumulate

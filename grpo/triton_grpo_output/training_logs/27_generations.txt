Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to compute the mean of each row. So for each row (each M element), I need to sum all the elements in that row and then divide by N. Since it's a mean, I have to handle the division properly, but since Triton is in Python, I can just do a division.

Next, the input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

Now, the memory layout. The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous. The kernel will process each row, so each thread should handle one row. But wait, how many threads per row? Let me think about block sizes. If I have a block size of, say, 128, then each block can process multiple rows. Wait, but if each row has N elements, and each thread processes one element, then for a row of N elements, we need N threads. But if the block size is 128, then for each row, we can have up to 128 threads. But if N is larger than 128, then multiple blocks would be needed. Alternatively, maybe I should have each thread handle one element in the row. But that might not be efficient.

Alternatively, maybe each thread processes one element in the row. So for each row, there are N elements. So the total number of threads would be M * N. But that's a lot. However, since Triton is designed for parallelism, maybe it's better to have each thread process one element. But that might not be efficient for large N. Alternatively, maybe we can process multiple elements per thread. Wait, but for the mean, we need to sum all elements in a row. So perhaps each thread can handle a chunk of elements in the row, but that would require more complex logic.

Alternatively, since the rows are contiguous, maybe each thread can handle one row. Wait, but each row has N elements. So for each row, we need to sum N elements. So if each thread is responsible for a row, then each thread would need to process N elements. But that's not efficient. Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. Then, for each row, there are N threads. But with M rows, that's M*N threads total. But that's possible.

But how to structure this. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The kernel will take the input tensor, and output tensor. The kernel will process each row. So the kernel should have a loop over the rows, and for each row, sum all elements.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows. So perhaps the kernel is structured as follows:

For each row in the input tensor:
   sum all elements in that row
   divide by N to get the mean
   store in the output tensor

So, the kernel needs to process each row. So the first thing is to determine how many rows there are. The input tensor has shape [M, N], so M rows. Each row has N elements.

Now, the kernel's threads. Each thread can be responsible for a single row. So the number of threads per block would be M. But if M is large, then the block size needs to be adjusted. But Triton allows for dynamic block sizes. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread process a single element in the row. But that's more threads.

Wait, but for the sum, each thread can process one element. So for a row, each element is processed by a thread. Then, the sum is computed by adding all the elements. But how to do that in a parallel way. For example, using a reduction.

But that's more complex. Alternatively, since the rows are contiguous, maybe we can process each row in a block. For example, each block handles one row. So each block has a certain number of threads, say, 128, and each thread processes one element in the row. Then, for each row, the threads in the block sum all the elements. But how to do that.

Alternatively, the kernel could be structured with a loop over the rows. For each row, the threads process the elements in that row. But how to structure that.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured as follows:

Each thread is responsible for a single element in the input tensor. So for each element, the thread adds it to a shared sum. Then, after all elements in the row are processed, the sum is divided by N.

But that's a reduction per

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to compute the mean of each row. So for each row (each M element), I need to sum all the elements in that row and then divide by N. Since it's a mean, I have to handle the division properly, but Triton doesn't have a built-in division operation, so I'll have to use integer division or maybe use floating points. Wait, the input tensor could be of any data type, but the output is a mean, which is typically a float. So I should assume that the input is a float tensor, and the output is a float tensor.

Next, the input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

Now, for the kernel. Triton kernels are written in a way that each thread processes a certain element. Since we're reducing along the last dimension (N), each thread should handle a single element in a row. But since we need to sum all elements in a row, each thread would need to accumulate the sum for its row. Wait, but if each thread is responsible for a single element, then each row would have N elements, and each thread would process one element. However, that's not efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can process multiple elements in a row per thread, but that depends on the block size.

Wait, the standard approach for reduction is to have each thread process a part of the data. But since the reduction is along the last dimension, each row is independent. So maybe each thread can handle a single element in the row, and then the threads in the block can combine their results. But for a row with N elements, if each thread processes one element, then each block would need to process N elements. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread process multiple elements in the row, but that depends on the block size.

Alternatively, since the reduction is along the last dimension, each row is independent. So for each row, we can compute the sum of the elements in that row. So the kernel can be structured such that each thread is responsible for a single row. Wait, but that's not possible because each row has N elements, and each thread would need to process all N elements of the row. That seems inefficient. Wait, maybe the kernel is designed to process each row, and each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. Then, the threads in the block would combine their results. But that's not straightforward.

Alternatively, think of it as a matrix where each row is processed. For each row, the sum is computed, then divided by N. So the kernel can be structured such that each thread is responsible for a single row. But that would require that each thread processes all elements in the row. But that's not efficient. Wait, perhaps the kernel is designed to process each row, and for each row, the threads in the block compute the sum of the elements in that row.

Wait, but in Triton, each thread is part of a warp, and each warp can have multiple threads. So maybe the kernel is designed such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. Then, for each row, all the threads in the block would process the elements of that row. But how to organize that.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured so that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. Then, for each row, the threads in the block would sum their elements. But how to handle that.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed to process each row as a separate reduction. For example, for each row, the threads in the block compute the sum of the elements in that row. But how to map the threads to the elements.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensor is [M, N], so each row is of length N. For each row i, the elements are at positions (i, 0), (i, 1), ..., (i, N-1). The output is [M], where each element is the sum of the row divided by N.

So for each row, we need to sum all N elements. So each row is a reduction along the last dimension. The kernel needs to process each row, sum its elements, then divide by N.

So the kernel can be structured as follows:

- Each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. But that's not efficient because each row has N elements. So for a row, there are N elements, and each thread would process one element. Then, the threads in the block would combine their results. But how to do that

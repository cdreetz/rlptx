Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum each column of the tensor. So for each column (which is along the N dimension), we need to add up all the elements in that column. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding column.

Next, input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor with dimensions M (rows) and N (columns). The output will be a 1D tensor with M elements. The memory layout is probably row-major, so each row is stored contiguously in memory. For a 2D tensor, the stride along the columns is 1, and along the rows is N.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels typically use a grid of blocks, each processing a portion of the data. For a sum reduction along the last dimension, each block can handle a range of columns. Wait, noâ€”since we're summing along the columns, each block should process a single column. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, the reduction is along the last dimension (columns). So for each column, we need to sum all the elements in that column. So each block can handle a single column. But how to process all columns? Let me think about how to structure the kernel.

Alternatively, perhaps each thread processes a single element in the tensor, and then threads combine their results. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, since the reduction is along the last dimension, maybe each block can process a single column, and each thread in the block handles a row in that column.

Wait, the tensor is [M, N]. So for each column j (from 0 to N-1), we need to sum all elements in column j, which are at positions (i, j) for i from 0 to M-1. So for each column, we can have a thread per row, but that would require M threads per column. But if M is large, that could be a lot of threads.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a reduction across the rows for each column. So each block handles a single column, and within the block, threads perform a reduction over the rows of that column.

But how to structure the threads. Let's think about the kernel parameters. The kernel will take the input tensor, and output tensor. The kernel needs to process all columns. So for each column, we need to sum all the elements in that column.

So, the kernel's grid size would be determined by the number of columns. Each block handles one column. Then, within each block, we process the rows of that column.

But how to map threads to columns. Let's say each block is responsible for a single column. Then, the number of blocks is N. Each block has multiple threads, each handling a row in that column.

But how to compute the column index for each thread. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The kernel will have a grid of blocks, each block handles one column. The block's index can be determined by the thread index in the grid. For example, the block index is the column index. Then, within each block, the threads process the rows of that column.

But how to handle the rows. For a column j, the rows are 0 to M-1. So each block (for column j) will have threads that process each row. But how to split the rows into threads. Let's say each block has a certain number of threads, say, BLOCK_SIZE. But if M is larger than BLOCK_SIZE, then we need to have multiple threads per block. Wait, but for a reduction, we need to have a way to combine the results.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread processes a single element in the tensor, and then threads combine their results. But that would require a reduction over the rows for each column. So for each column, we need to perform a reduction over the rows. So for each column, the threads would be arranged in a way that they can perform a reduction.

But how to structure this. Let's think of the kernel as follows:

- The kernel is responsible for summing each column. So for each column j, we need to sum all elements in that column.

- The kernel's grid is determined by the number of columns N. Each block is responsible for a single column j.

- Within each block, we have threads that process the rows of column j. For example, if the block has BLOCK_SIZE threads, then each thread handles a row in the column. But if M is larger than BLOCK_SIZE, we need to have multiple threads per block. Wait, but that's not possible. So perhaps the block

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is to sum each column of the tensor. So for each column (which is along the N dimension), we need to add up all the elements in that column. The input tensor is 2D, with M rows and N columns. The output should be a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the sum of the corresponding column.

Now, thinking about GPU operations. Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for parallelism. So I need to figure out how to partition the work across threads. Since we're summing along the last dimension (columns), each thread should be responsible for a single column. Wait, no, actually, each thread can handle a single element in the column, but we need to accumulate the sum for each column.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of blocks. Let's say each block handles a certain number of columns. But since the columns are along the second dimension, maybe each thread in the block can process a single element in a column. But how to organize this.

Alternatively, since the reduction is along the last dimension, each thread can process a single element in the column, and then the threads in the block can perform a reduction to sum all the elements in that column. But how to structure that.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensor is [M, N], so each row is M elements, and there are N rows. Wait, no, in matrix terms, it's M rows and N columns. So the tensor is arranged as M rows, each with N elements. So for a column, it's N elements. So for each column, we need to sum all N elements in that column.

But how to do this in Triton. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The kernel needs to take the input tensor, and output the sum for each column. So the output tensor will have shape [N], since there are N columns. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the original tensor is [M, N], so each column has M elements. Wait, no, the shape is [M, N], so the first dimension is M (rows), the second is N (columns). So each column has M elements. So the sum along the last dimension (columns) would be summing each column's M elements. So the output should be a 1D tensor of size N, where each element is the sum of the column.

Wait, the user said "sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]". So the last dimension is N. So the reduction is over the N dimension. So the output is a tensor of shape [M], but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. Wait, if the tensor is [M, N], then the last dimension is N. So reducing along the last dimension (N) would mean that for each element in the first dimension (M), we sum across the N elements. Wait, that would be summing each row. But that's not what the user said. Wait, maybe I'm confused.

Wait, the user says "sum reduction along the last dimension". The last dimension is N. So for each element in the first dimension (M), we sum across the N elements. So the output would be a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the sum of the corresponding row. But that's not the case. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to reduce along the first dimension (M), which would give a tensor of size N. But the user says "last dimension", which is N. So perhaps the problem is to sum each column, which would be along the N dimension. Wait, no. Let's clarify:

If the tensor is [M, N], then each column is along the second dimension. So for example, if M=3, N=2, the tensor is:

[ [a, b],
  [c, d],
  [e, f] ]

Summing along the last dimension (N) would mean summing each row. So for row 0, a + b; row 1, c + d; row 2, e + f. The output would be [a+b, c+d, e+f], which is a tensor of shape [M]. But that's summing along the last dimension. However, the user might have intended to sum along the first dimension, but that's not clear.

Wait, the user's question says "sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]". So the last dimension is N. So the reduction is over the N dimension

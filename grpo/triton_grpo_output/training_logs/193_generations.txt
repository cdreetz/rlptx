Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through the steps.

First, I remember that matrix multiplication involves computing the dot product of rows from the first matrix and columns from the second matrix. But since we're using shared memory, we need to break down the problem into tiles. So, the idea is to load chunks of the matrices into shared memory, compute the dot product for each tile, and then accumulate the result.

The input tensors are A (M, K) and B (K, N). The output is C (M, N). Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

For tile-based computation, I need to decide on the tile size. Typically, people use 128 or 256 elements per tile. Let's say we use a tile size of 128. So, each tile will be of size (tile_size, tile_size), where tile_size is 128. But wait, the matrices might not be perfectly divisible by the tile size, so we need to handle that with masking.

Now, the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. For shared memory, I'll need to load chunks of A and B into shared memory. Let's say for matrix A, each tile is of size (tile_size, tile_size), so each tile in shared memory will be a block of A's rows. Similarly for B, each tile is a block of columns.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as for each block of rows in A and columns in B. So, for each tile, we load a block of A's rows (say, rows i to i+tile_size-1) and a block of B's columns (columns j to j+tile_size-1). Then compute the dot product between these blocks.

But how to structure the kernel? The kernel should iterate over each element in the output matrix C. For each element C[i][j], we need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. But with shared memory, we can compute this in blocks.

Let me think about the steps:

1. The kernel will process each element (i, j) in the output matrix C. However, since we're using tile-based computation, we need to process tiles of A and B.

2. For each tile in A (rows i to i+tile_size-1) and tile in B (columns j to j+tile_size-1), compute the dot product between the corresponding tiles.

3. The shared memory for A will store a block of rows, and for B a block of columns. Then, for each element in the tile, we compute the sum.

But how to handle the indices. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The kernel should take the input tensors A and B, and the output tensor C. But in Triton, the kernel is written in a way that each thread handles a specific element in the output.

Wait, maybe I should structure the kernel such that each thread handles a specific tile. Alternatively, each thread could handle a specific element in the output matrix. But with tile-based computation, the threads would work on different tiles.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured to process each tile of the output matrix. For example, for each tile of size (tile_size, tile_size) in C, we compute the corresponding tiles in A and B.

But I need to think about the kernel's parameters. The kernel will be launched with the shape of the output matrix C (M, N). Each thread will handle a specific (i, j) in C. However, with tile-based computation, each thread might be responsible for a certain tile.

Alternatively, the kernel could be structured such that each thread is responsible for a certain element in the output matrix, but with the shared memory holding tiles of A and B. For example, for each element (i, j) in C, the thread would compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j], but using shared memory to hold the tiles.

Wait, but that's not efficient. The standard approach for matrix multiplication with shared memory is to load tiles of A and B into shared memory, compute the dot product for each tile, and then accumulate the result into C.

So, the kernel would be structured as follows:

- For each tile of A (rows i to i+tile_size-1) and tile of B (columns j to j+tile_size-1), compute the dot product between the corresponding tiles.

But how to map this to the kernel's threads. Let me think of the kernel as processing each tile in the output matrix. For example, the kernel would process tiles of size (tile_size

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that matrix multiplication involves computing the dot product of rows from the first matrix and columns from the second matrix. For efficiency, especially on GPUs, using shared memory and tiling is important to reduce memory latency and improve bandwidth utilization.

So the input tensors are A (M, K) and B (K, N). The output will be C (M, N), where each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k.

In Triton, I need to structure the kernel to handle this. The key steps would be:

1. **Determine the tile size**: Typically, a block size of 32 or 64 elements is used. Let's say we use 32 elements per tile. But I need to check if that's optimal for the problem.

2. **Shared memory allocation**: Each thread block will load a tile of A and B into shared memory. Since A is of size MxK and B is KxN, the tiles need to be of size (tile_size, tile_size). Wait, but the tiles for A and B would be (tile_size, tile_size), but for matrix multiplication, the tiles need to be compatible. Let me think: for A, each tile is (tile_size, tile_size), and for B, each tile is (tile_size, tile_size). Then, the dot product between these tiles would be (tile_size * tile_size) operations. But the actual tile size depends on how we split the matrices.

Wait, maybe I should use a block size of 32, and each thread block handles a tile of size (32, 32) for A and B. But the actual tile size for A and B would be such that the number of tiles along K is manageable. Alternatively, maybe the tile size is chosen such that the number of elements in each tile is manageable for the shared memory.

Alternatively, the tile size is determined by the block size. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread block can handle a tile of size (32, 32) for A and B. But I need to make sure that the tiles fit into shared memory.

So, the shared memory for A and B would be of size (tile_size, tile_size) each. Then, for each thread in the block, they compute a part of the dot product.

Wait, but in matrix multiplication, each thread block would handle a portion of the matrix. For example, each block would compute a block of the output matrix C. So, the threads in the block would compute the dot product between a row of A and a column of B.

But with tiling, the idea is to split the matrices into tiles and compute the product in chunks. So, for each tile of A and B, we compute the corresponding part of C.

But I need to think about how the threads are organized. Each thread in the block would handle a specific element in the tile of A and B, and compute their product, then accumulate into the corresponding position in the output.

Alternatively, maybe each thread block is responsible for computing a certain region of the output matrix. For example, if the block is responsible for rows i to i+block_rows-1 of A and columns j to j+block_cols-1 of B, then each thread would compute a part of the dot product.

But I think the standard approach for Triton matrix multiplication is to have each thread block compute a tile of the output matrix. So, the block is responsible for a certain region of C, and each thread in the block computes a part of that tile.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to use a block size of 32, and each thread block computes a tile of size (block_rows, block_cols) in the output matrix. Then, for each tile of A and B, the threads compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B.

But how to structure this. Let me think again.

In the standard matrix multiplication, each thread block is responsible for a block of the output matrix. The threads in the block compute the dot product between a row of A and a column of B. However, with tiling, the matrices A and B are split into tiles, and the threads compute the product of tiles.

Alternatively, the approach is to split the matrices into tiles of size (tile_size, tile_size), and each thread block computes the product of a tile of A and a tile of B. But this is more complex.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use a block size of 32, and each thread block is responsible for computing a certain number of rows in A and

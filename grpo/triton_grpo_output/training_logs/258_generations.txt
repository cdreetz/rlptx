Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum each column of the 2D tensor. So for each column (which is the last dimension), we need to add up all the elements in that column. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding column.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor with dimensions M (rows) and N (columns). The output is a 1D tensor with M elements. So for each row in the input, we need to accumulate the sum across the columns.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels use blocks, and I need to decide on a block size. A common approach is to use a block size that allows efficient memory access. Since we're processing columns, maybe each thread can handle a single column. But if the number of columns is large, we might need multiple threads per column. Alternatively, maybe each thread processes a single element in the column, and the block handles the accumulation.

Wait, for sum reduction along the last dimension, each thread can be responsible for a single column. But if there are many columns, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each thread processes a single element in the column, and the block accumulates the sum for that column. But how to organize this.

Let me think: For a 2D tensor, each column is a vector of length M. So for each column, we need to sum all M elements. So the kernel should iterate over each column, and for each column, sum all the elements in that column.

But how to structure the threads. Let's say we have N columns. Each thread can be responsible for a single column. So the number of threads per block would be N. But if N is large, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the column, and the block accumulates the sum for that column.

Wait, but for each column, there are M elements. So if we have a block that processes a column, then each thread in the block would process one element in that column. But that would require that the block size is M, which could be large. Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the column, and the block accumulates the sum for that column.

But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can use a block size that is a multiple of the number of columns. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the column. Then, for each column, all threads in the block process that column's elements. But how to coordinate that.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured to process each column, and each thread in the block handles a single element in that column. So for each column, the block processes all elements in that column. But that would require that the block size is M, which could be large. However, if M is large, that's not feasible. So perhaps we need to use a different approach.

Wait, maybe the kernel is structured as follows: each thread is responsible for a single element in the column. The block is responsible for a single column. So for each column, the block has multiple threads, each processing one element. Then, the block accumulates the sum for that column.

But how to determine the number of threads per block. Let's say the number of columns is N. Then, each block processes a single column, and the number of threads per block is M. But that's possible only if M is small. If M is large, then the block size would be too big. So maybe that's not the way.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a different approach. Let's think about the problem as a sum over the last dimension. So for each row in the input tensor, we need to sum all elements in that row's column. Wait, no. Wait, the tensor is [M, N], so each column has M elements. So the sum along the last dimension (N) would be summing each column. So for each column j (from 0 to N-1), sum over i from 0 to M-1 of input[i][j].

So the output is a vector of size M, where output[i] = sum_{j} input[i][j] ?

Wait, no. Wait, the last dimension is N. So sum along the last dimension would be for each row i, sum over all columns j. Wait, no. Wait, the tensor is [M, N]. The last dimension is N. So sum along the last dimension would be for each row i, sum over j from 0 to N-

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum over the last dimension, which is N. So for each row in the tensor (each row is of length N), I need to sum all the elements. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding row.

Next, input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. The output is a 1D tensor with shape [M]. The memory layout is probably row-major, so each row is contiguous in memory. So for a tensor of shape [M, N], the elements are stored as [0, 1, 2, ..., N-1, N, N+1, ...] for the first row, then the next row starts at index N, etc.

Now, optimal block sizes and memory access patterns. Since we're processing each row, each block can handle one row. But since each row has N elements, the number of threads per block depends on N. However, Triton's blocks can be configured with a certain number of threads. Let's think about how to structure the threads.

Each thread in the block can handle a single element in the row. But since we need to sum all elements in the row, each thread would need to add its element to a shared accumulator. However, if N is large, using a single thread per element might not be efficient. Alternatively, we can divide the row into chunks, each handled by a thread. But since the sum is a reduction, perhaps using a reduction pattern where threads work together to sum.

Wait, but for each row, the sum is over all elements. So for a given row, each thread can compute a partial sum, and then the threads can combine their partial sums. But how to structure this.

Alternatively, since each row is processed independently, maybe each block can process a single row. So each block is responsible for summing one row. Then, the number of blocks would be M, but that's not efficient if M is large. Wait, but in Triton, the number of blocks is determined by the grid size. So perhaps the grid is M blocks, each handling one row. But if M is large, this could be a problem. However, given that the kernel is designed for a 2D tensor, maybe the grid is determined by the number of rows.

But for a 2D tensor, the rows are M in number, each with N elements. So for each row, we need to sum N elements. So each block can process one row. The number of threads per block would be the number of elements in the row, but that's not efficient. Alternatively, we can have each block process a chunk of elements in the row, and then perform a reduction.

Wait, perhaps the best approach is to have each thread in the block handle a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction across the threads in the block. But that would require that each block processes a single row, and the threads in the block are responsible for adding the elements in that row.

But how to structure the threads. Let's think about the block size. For a row of N elements, if we have a block size of, say, 128 threads, then each block can handle up to 128 elements. But if N is larger than 128, then multiple blocks would be needed for a single row. But that's not efficient. Alternatively, we can have each thread in the block process a single element, and then the block reduces the sum of all elements in the row.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, each thread in the block would process one element. Then, the block would perform a reduction to sum all the elements. So the number of threads per block would be the number of elements in the row. But that's not feasible if N is large. So perhaps we need to use a different approach.

Alternatively, we can process each row in a way that each thread handles a portion of the row, and then combine the results. For example, using a reduction pattern where threads split the row into chunks and combine their results.

But perhaps the simplest way is to have each thread in the block handle a single element in the row. Then, the block reduces the sum of all elements in the row. However, this requires that the block size is at least as large as the number of elements in the row, which is not feasible for large N. Therefore, this approach might not be efficient.

Alternatively, we can use a more efficient reduction strategy. For example, using a reduction over the elements of the row, where each thread is responsible for a portion of the row and combines with others.

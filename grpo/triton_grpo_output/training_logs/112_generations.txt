Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations required. The task is to sum over the last dimension, which is N. So for each row in the tensor (each row is of length N), we need to sum all the elements. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding row.

Next, input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. The output will be a 1D tensor with shape [M]. The memory layout is important here. Since we're processing rows, each thread should handle a single row. But how to organize the data?

For the kernel, I need to decide on the block size. Triton kernels typically use a grid of blocks, each handling a portion of the data. Since each row is independent, each block can handle one row. But maybe using a block size that allows multiple threads per block to process different elements in the row. Wait, but if each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, then each thread would process one element. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and the block processes the entire row. But how?

Wait, the sum over the last dimension (N) for each row. So for each row, we need to sum all N elements. So each thread can be responsible for a single element in the row. But if we have N elements per row, then for each row, we need N threads. But if the row is of size N, then for each row, we can have multiple threads working on different elements. However, if the block size is set to something like 1024, then each block can process multiple elements in a row. But how to handle that?

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. So for each row, there are N elements, and each thread processes one. But then, for each row, we need N threads. However, if the row is of size N, then for each row, the number of threads per block would be N. But if the block size is set to something like 1024, then for N=1024, each block can process one row. But if N is smaller, then maybe multiple threads per block can process different elements in the same row.

Wait, maybe the approach is to have each thread process a single element in the row, and then accumulate the sum. But how to do that efficiently.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel can be structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. So for each row, the threads process each element. But since each row is of length N, the number of threads per row is N. However, if the row is large, this could be inefficient. But for a sum reduction, maybe it's manageable.

But maybe a better approach is to have each thread process a single element in the row, and then the threads in the block sum their contributions. But that would require that each thread has a unique index in the row. So for each row, the threads would iterate over the elements of the row, and sum them.

But how to structure the kernel. Let me think about the parameters. The kernel needs to take the input tensor, and compute the sum for each row. The output is a tensor of shape [M].

So, for each row i in 0..M-1, sum all elements in row i.

In Triton, the kernel is written with a grid and a block. The grid is determined by the number of rows, and each block processes one row. But how to handle the elements in the row.

Each thread in the block would process one element in the row. So for a row i, the threads would process elements from 0 to N-1. But how to map the thread index to the element index in the row.

Alternatively, each block can process a single row, and each thread in the block processes a single element in the row. So the block size would be the number of elements in the row. But that's not feasible if N is large, since the block size can't be larger than 1024. So for example, if N is 1024, then each block can process one row. But if N is 2048, then each block would have 2048 threads, which is not possible. So that approach might not work.

Wait, but in Triton, the block size is set with the BLOCK_SIZE constant. So perhaps the kernel is designed such that each block processes a single row, and each thread in the block is responsible for a single element in the

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations required. Since it's a sum reduction along the last dimension (i.e., column-wise sum for each row), each thread should process a single element in the tensor. But wait, maybe I can have threads process multiple elements if there's a way to group them. However, since the reduction is along the last dimension, each thread might need to handle a single element and then accumulate the sum. But for efficiency, maybe using a reduction pattern where each thread processes a block of elements and then reduces them.

Wait, but for a 2D tensor, the last dimension is N. So for each row (M rows), we need to sum across N elements. So each row is a vector of N elements, and we need to sum them. So for each row, the sum is the sum of all elements in that row.

So the kernel needs to process each row. Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensor is [M, N], so each row is of length N. The output will be a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the sum of the corresponding row.

Now, the Triton kernel will have threads processing elements. Let's think about how to structure the threads. For each row, we need to process all N elements. But how to distribute this across threads. Maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. But that would require M*N threads, which might be too many. Alternatively, we can have each thread process a block of elements, but since the reduction is along the last dimension, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element and then perform a reduction.

Wait, but for a sum reduction, the standard approach is to have each thread process a single element, then perform a reduction. However, if the number of elements per row is large, this could be inefficient. But in Triton, the kernel can be written to handle this.

Alternatively, maybe we can process each row in a way that each thread handles a chunk of elements. But for a sum, it's easier to have each thread handle a single element and then reduce across threads. However, for a 2D tensor, the rows are independent. So perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then the threads in the same row reduce their values.

Wait, but how to structure that. Let me think about the kernel's parameters. The input tensor is 2D, with shape [M, N]. The output is a 1D tensor of size M. So for each row i, we need to sum all elements in that row.

In Triton, the kernel is written with a grid and a block. Let's consider that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. But that would require each thread to process one element, then accumulate the sum. However, for a row with N elements, there are N threads processing that row. But if N is large, this could be inefficient. However, Triton can handle that.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a more efficient approach by grouping elements. For example, if N is a power of two, we can have each thread process a block of elements and then reduce. But since the problem is to sum all elements in a row, the standard approach is to have each thread process one element and then perform a reduction across all threads in the row.

But how to structure that. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The input is a 2D tensor, so we need to access it as [i, j], where i is the row index and j is the column index. The output is a 1D tensor where each element is the sum of the row.

So, the kernel will have to iterate over each row, and for each row, iterate over each column, summing the elements. But in Triton, the kernel is written with a grid and a block. Let's think about the grid size. The grid size should be M, since there are M rows. Each block processes one row. But how to structure the threads within the block.

Wait, for each row, the number of elements is N. So, for each row, the block will have N threads. But if N is large, that could be a problem. However, Triton allows for dynamic grid and block sizes. Alternatively, maybe we can use a block size that is a power of two, and compute the number of threads per block as N, but that might not be efficient.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is designed such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then the threads in the block reduce their values. But how to do that.

Let me think of the standard approach for a reduction. For example, in a

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the max of the elements in that row). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the maximum of N elements.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the maximum of the corresponding row.

Memory layout: The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. The output tensor will be a 1D array where each element corresponds to a row's maximum.

Optimal block sizes and memory access patterns. Since we're processing each row independently, each block can handle one row. But since the rows are in contiguous memory, maybe we can process them in a way that each thread handles a column. Wait, no. Wait, for each row, we need to find the max of N elements. So, for a row, each thread could be responsible for a certain element. But how to organize this.

Alternatively, since each row is processed independently, perhaps each thread block handles one row. But for a row of N elements, how many threads per block? Let's think about the number of threads per block. If N is large, we need to have enough threads per block to process all elements in the row. But if the block size is too small, it might be inefficient. So, perhaps using a block size that is a power of two, like 256, and then each thread handles a portion of the row.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, each thread can take care of a certain element. But how to do that. Let me think. For each row, the maximum can be computed by having each thread compare the elements and keep track of the maximum. But in Triton, threads can be organized in a way that each thread handles a specific element in the row.

Alternatively, for each row, we can have multiple threads working on that row. For example, if the row has N elements, and we have a block size of, say, 256, then each block can handle a row if N is larger than the block size. But if N is smaller than the block size, then threads can be arranged to process the elements.

But perhaps the best way is to have each thread process a single element in the row, and then the threads in the block compute the max of their elements. So, for a row, each thread takes an element, and then the threads in the block compute the maximum among all their elements.

So, for each row, the threads in the block will compute the max of the row. So, the block size should be such that it can handle the number of elements in the row. But since the row can be of varying lengths (N), we need to make sure that the block size is chosen such that it can handle the maximum possible N.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a fixed block size. So, perhaps we can choose a block size that's a power of two, like 256, and then for each row, the threads in the block will process the elements in that row. However, if N is smaller than the block size, then the extra threads in the block would be masked out.

So, the steps for the kernel would be:

1. For each row (i.e., each M element), process the elements in that row.
2. For each row, compute the maximum of the N elements.
3. Store the maximum in the output tensor.

Now, the kernel needs to iterate over each row. Let's think about the indices. The input tensor is [M, N], so for each row i, the elements are at positions (i, 0), (i, 1), ..., (i, N-1).

In Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows. For each row, we need to process all N elements. So, the kernel will have a loop over the rows (i), and for each row, process the elements in that row.

But how to handle the threads. Let's think about the threads per block. Let's say we have a block size of 256. For each row, the threads in the block will process the elements in that row. For example, each thread can be responsible for a certain element in the row. But how to map the thread index to the element index.

Alternatively, for each row, the threads in the block can compute the max of the elements in that row. So, for a given row, the threads

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations required. The task is to compute the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the maximum element). So for each row (each M element), we need to find the max of N elements.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the max of the corresponding row.

Now, considering the memory layout. The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. The output will be a 1D array where each element corresponds to a row's maximum.

For the kernel, I need to determine the block size. Since we're processing rows, each threadblock should handle one row. But how many threads per block? Let's think about the number of elements per row (N). If N is large, we need multiple threads per block. A common approach is to use a block size that's a power of two, like 256. But since each thread processes one element in the row, the number of threads per block should be equal to the number of elements in the row (N). However, since N can vary, maybe we need to use a dynamic block size. Wait, but Triton kernels have fixed block sizes. So perhaps we need to compute the number of threads per block based on N. Alternatively, use a fixed block size and handle cases where N is not a multiple of the block size. But maybe for simplicity, we can use a block size that's a power of two, say 256, and handle the remainder with masking.

Wait, but in this case, each thread is responsible for one element in the row. So for each row, we have N elements. So the number of threads per block should be N. But since N can be arbitrary, perhaps we need to use a dynamic block size. However, Triton allows us to use a fixed block size. So maybe we can use a block size that's a power of two, and then handle the remainder with masking. Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed to process each row in a way that each threadblock handles one row, and each thread within the block processes one element in the row. Wait, but that would require the block size to be equal to the number of elements in the row, which varies. Hmm, perhaps that's not feasible. Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed to process each row in a way that each threadblock handles one row, and each thread in the block processes one element in the row. But that would require that the number of threads per block is equal to the number of elements in the row. However, since the number of elements per row (N) can be different for different rows, this might not be possible. Wait, but in this case, the rows are all of the same length N. So perhaps each threadblock is responsible for a single row, and each thread in the block processes one element in that row. But how to determine how many threads per block? Well, the number of threads per block would be N. But since N can be large, maybe we need to use a block size that's a power of two, and then handle the remainder. Alternatively, maybe we can use a block size that's a power of two, and for each row, we process all elements in the row, with threads per block being the number of elements in the row. But how to handle that in Triton.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a block size that's 256, and for each row, the threads in the block process the elements in the row. For example, if N is 1024, then each block would have 1024 threads, but that's not feasible. Wait, but Triton allows for dynamic block sizes. Wait, no, the block size is fixed when you write the kernel. So maybe we need to use a block size that's a power of two, and then for each row, the threads in the block process the elements in the row. But how to handle when N is not a multiple of the block size. For example, if N is 1000, and the block size is 256, then each block would process 256 elements, but the last block would process 1000 - 256*3 = 1000 - 768 = 232 elements. But in that case, the threads in the block would need to process the elements in the row, but only up to the N elements. So, for each

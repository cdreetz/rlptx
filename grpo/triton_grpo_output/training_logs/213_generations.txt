Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the minimum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the minimum of the elements in that row). So for each row (each M element), I need to compute the min of N elements.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Now, considering the memory layout. The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. For each row, the elements are stored consecutively. So for row i, the elements are at positions i*N to i*N + N - 1.

Optimal block sizes and memory access patterns. Since each row has N elements, and we need to process all elements in a row, the block size should be chosen such that each thread processes a portion of the row. However, since the reduction is across the entire row, perhaps each thread can handle a segment of the row and then combine results. But for a min reduction, it's more efficient to have each thread process a single element and then combine them. Wait, but for a reduction, it's common to use a warp-level reduction. However, since each row is processed independently, maybe each thread can handle a single element and then perform a reduction within the warp.

Wait, but for a 2D tensor, each row is processed independently. So perhaps the kernel can be structured such that each thread handles a single row. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, each thread can handle a portion of the row. Let me think.

Alternatively, for each row, we can have threads that process elements in that row. But since the rows are independent, perhaps the kernel can be structured with each thread handling a single row. But that would require that each thread processes the entire row. However, that might not be efficient in terms of parallelism. Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction across the elements in the row.

Wait, but for a min reduction, the approach is to have each thread take a portion of the elements, and then combine them. For example, in a warp, each thread can take a chunk of elements and compute the min, then combine with others. But for a row of N elements, the number of threads per row would depend on how we split the elements.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction across all elements in the row. But that would require that each thread has access to the elements in the row. However, for a 2D tensor, each row is contiguous. So, for row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j for j from 0 to N-1.

So, the plan is: for each row i, compute the min of the elements in that row. The kernel will process each row independently. So, the kernel can be structured with each thread handling a single row. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread handles a single element in the row, and then the threads in the warp perform a reduction.

But how to structure this. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The input tensor is of shape [M, N], and the output is [M]. So, each row is processed independently.

So, the kernel can be structured with each thread processing a single row. But for that, the number of threads per block would be M. However, if M is large, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured with each thread handling a single element in the row, and then the threads in the warp perform a reduction. But that would require that each thread is assigned a position in the row.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured with each thread handling a single row. For example, each thread is responsible for row i. Then, within that row, the thread needs to compute the min of all elements in that row. But how to do that efficiently.

Wait, for each row, the thread needs to iterate through all elements in the row and find the minimum. But that would require that each thread has access to all elements in the row. However, with a warp-level reduction, perhaps each thread can take a chunk of elements and compute the min, then combine with others.

But how to structure that. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. Let's assume that the kernel is written with the following parameters: the input tensor is a 2D tensor, and the output is

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the minimum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the minimum of the elements in that row). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the min of N elements.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Now, considering the memory layout. The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. For each row, we need to process all N elements. The output will be a single value per row.

Optimal block sizes and memory access patterns. Since each row has N elements, the block size should be chosen to efficiently process these elements. A common approach is to use a block size that's a power of two, but it depends on N. However, since we're processing each row independently, perhaps a block size of N is possible, but that might not be efficient for varying N. Alternatively, using a block size that's a power of two, like 256, and using shared memory to store the elements of the row. Wait, but if N is not a multiple of the block size, we need to handle that. Alternatively, maybe using a block size that's suitable for the number of elements per row. But since each row is processed independently, perhaps each thread can handle a single element, but that would be inefficient. Alternatively, using a block size that processes multiple elements per thread.

Wait, for a min reduction, each thread can take care of a subset of the elements. But since we need to find the minimum, each thread would need to compare elements. However, for a row of N elements, each thread could be responsible for a portion of the elements. But how to structure that.

Alternatively, perhaps each thread processes a single element, and then the threads compare their values to find the minimum. But that would require a reduction step. However, with a block size of 256, each thread could be responsible for a single element, and then the threads in the block perform a reduction to find the minimum. But that would require that each thread has a value, and then the threads in the block reduce them. However, for a row of N elements, the number of threads per block would be N, but if N is larger than the block size, then multiple blocks would be needed. Wait, but in Triton, each block can have multiple threads, and each thread can process a part of the data.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread processes a single element in the row, and then the threads in the block perform a reduction to find the minimum for that row. But how to handle that.

Let me think. For a row i, the elements are from column 0 to N-1. Each thread in the block can be responsible for a single element. Then, the threads in the block reduce their values to find the minimum. However, if the block size is smaller than N, then there are multiple blocks for the same row. Wait, no. Each row is processed by a block. Wait, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each block processes a single row. So, for each row i, we have a block that processes that row. Then, within that block, the threads perform a reduction to find the minimum of the row.

But how to map the threads to the elements of the row. Let's say the block size is 256. For a row with N elements, each thread in the block can be responsible for a single element. Then, the threads in the block perform a reduction to find the minimum. However, if N is smaller than the block size, then some threads would be idle. But that's acceptable.

So, the steps would be:

For each row i in 0 to M-1:

- Load the elements of row i into shared memory.

- Perform a reduction over the elements in the row to find the minimum.

- Store the minimum in the output tensor.

But how to handle the shared memory. Let's think about the kernel structure.

The kernel would have a loop over the rows. For each row, the threads in the block process the elements of that row.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows, and then within that, the threads process the elements of the row.

So, the kernel would look something like this:

@triton.jit
def kernel(input, output, M, N):
    # Compute the row index
    row_idx = tl.program_id(0

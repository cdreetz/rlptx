Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum each column of the tensor. So for each column (which is along the second dimension, since the tensor is [M, N]), we need to add up all the elements in that column. So for each row in the first dimension (M), we'll have a column in the second dimension (N), and we need to sum across the rows.

Next, the input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [N], where each element is the sum of the corresponding column. So for each column j in 0 to N-1, output[j] = sum_{i=0}^{M-1} input[i][j].

Now, considering the memory layout. The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous. For a 2D tensor, the elements are stored as [0, 1, 2, ..., N-1, N, N+1, ...], so for row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j for column j.

For the kernel, I need to process each column. So each thread should handle a specific column. But how to organize the threads? Maybe each thread is responsible for a single column. But since there are N columns, and each column has M elements, we need to process each column's elements.

Wait, but in Triton, threads are organized into blocks. So perhaps we can have each block handle a single column. Let's think about the block size. Let's say each block processes one column. So each block will have a thread that iterates over all the elements in that column. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each block handles multiple columns, but that depends on how the threads are arranged.

Alternatively, since each column has M elements, and each thread can process one element in the column. So for each column j, we have M elements. So the kernel should iterate over each column j, and for each element in that column, add them up.

But how to structure the threads. Let me think about the grid and block dimensions. The grid will have N blocks (one per column). Each block will have multiple threads. Let's say each block has a certain number of threads, say BLOCK_SIZE. But how to compute the sum for each column.

Wait, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element in the column. So for a given column j, each thread i in the block would compute input[i][j], and then sum them all. But that would require each thread to process one element. However, since there are M elements per column, and each block can have up to BLOCK_SIZE threads, we need to have enough blocks to cover all columns. Wait, no. The grid is determined by the number of columns, N. Each block processes one column. So the grid has N blocks. Each block has BLOCK_SIZE threads. Each thread in the block processes one element in the column. Wait, but that would require that each block has M elements. But that's not possible if M is larger than BLOCK_SIZE. So maybe that approach is not right.

Alternatively, maybe each block processes a range of elements in the column. For example, if the column has M elements, and the block has BLOCK_SIZE threads, each thread can process a chunk of elements. But that would require that the block can handle the elements in the column. But how to compute the sum for the entire column.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single column. But that would require that each thread handles all elements in that column. But that would be inefficient, as each thread would have to process M elements. However, if M is large, that's not efficient. So maybe the better approach is to have each thread process a single element in the column, and then the block sums them all. But how to organize that.

Wait, let's think of the kernel as follows: for each column j, we have M elements. Each thread in the block is responsible for a single element in that column. Then, the block sums all the elements in that column. But how to compute which elements each thread is responsible for.

Alternatively, maybe each block is responsible for a single column, and each thread in the block is responsible for a single element in that column. But that would require that the block has enough threads to process all elements in the column. But if the column has M elements, and the block size is BLOCK_SIZE, then the number of blocks would be N, and each block would have M elements. But that's not possible if M is larger than the block size. So maybe that's not

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum each column of the tensor. So for each column (which is along the N dimension), we need to add up all the elements in that column. The input is a 2D tensor with M rows and N columns. The output should be a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the sum of the corresponding column.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The input is [M, N], and the output is [M]. The memory layout is important. Since it's a 2D tensor, I'll assume it's stored in row-major order, which is standard. So each row is contiguous in memory. For a column-wise sum, each thread should handle one column.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels use warps and threads. Let's think about how to partition the work. Since we're summing columns, each thread can handle a single column. But how many threads per block? Let's say we use a block size of 1024, which is a common choice. But since each thread processes one column, the number of threads per block would be the number of columns, N. However, if N is large, this might not be efficient. Wait, but if the number of columns is N, then each block can process multiple columns. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of how many columns each thread can handle. Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single column. But that might not be efficient if N is large. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread process a single column, but that would require that each thread is assigned a column index. But with a block size of 1024, if N is larger than 1024, then multiple blocks are needed. But in Triton, the kernel is launched with a certain number of blocks, and each block handles a portion of the work.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to have each thread process a single column. So for each column, we have a thread that sums all the elements in that column. But how do we map the threads to columns? Let's think: the number of threads per block is the number of columns, N. But that's not feasible if N is large. Alternatively, perhaps each block handles a range of columns, and each thread within the block handles a single column. But that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed such that each thread is responsible for a single column, and the number of threads per block is the number of columns. But that's not possible if N is larger than the block size. So maybe we need to use a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed to process each column in a way that each thread is responsible for a single element in the column. Wait, no. For sum reduction along the last dimension (columns), each column is a vector of M elements. So for each column, we need to sum all M elements. So if we have a block of threads, each thread can process a single element in the column, but that would require that each thread is assigned a specific element in the column. But that's not efficient. Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single column, and the thread processes all elements in that column. But how to do that?

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to have each thread process a single column. So for each column, we have a thread that loads all the elements in that column and sums them. But how to do that in Triton. Let me think about the steps.

The kernel will need to:

1. Determine the number of columns, N.
2. For each column index (let's say col in 0..N-1), each thread is responsible for that column.
3. For each column, the thread needs to read all the elements in that column (from row 0 to M-1) and sum them.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let's think about the kernel parameters. The input tensor is of shape [M, N], so each element is at position (i, j), where i is the row index and j is the column index. The output is a tensor of shape [N], where each element is the sum of column j.

Wait, wait, the original problem says the output is [M], but that's not right. Wait, the problem says "sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]". The last dimension is N, so the reduction is along N. So the output should be of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding column. Wait, no. Wait, if the tensor is [

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that adds two 1D tensors element-wise. Let me start by understanding what's required here.

First, the GPU operations. The main task is to add corresponding elements from two input tensors and produce an output tensor. So, for each element in the input tensors, I'll add them together and store the result in the output.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The problem states that both input tensors are 1D of size N. So, each has shape (N,). The output will also be a 1D tensor of size N. The memory layout is probably contiguous in memory, so each tensor is stored as a flat array in memory. So, for a given index i, the element is at position i in the array.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels use blocks of a certain size. The optimal block size depends on the problem. For element-wise operations, a common approach is to use a block size that divides the total number of elements, but since N can be arbitrary, maybe using a dynamic block size. However, for simplicity, perhaps using a fixed block size like 256 or 512. Let's think about how to handle the loop over the elements.

Each thread in the block will handle a single element. Wait, but if the block size is 256, then each thread would process one element. But maybe that's not efficient. Alternatively, if the block size is larger, but each thread processes one element. Wait, maybe for simplicity, each thread handles one element. So, the number of threads per block is determined by the number of elements, but since Triton can handle dynamic thread counts, perhaps we can compute the number of threads per block as the total number of elements divided by the block size, but that's more for the kernel launch configuration.

Wait, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. So, each thread will process one element. So, the kernel will have a loop that iterates over each element, and each thread computes one element. But how to handle that in Triton.

In Triton, the kernel is written with a loop that runs for the number of elements. Each thread in the block will process one element. So, the kernel will have a loop over i in 0..N-1, and each thread computes i. But how to make sure that each thread processes a unique i. So, the kernel will have a loop that runs for the number of elements, and each thread is assigned a unique i. But how to do that in Triton.

Wait, in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop that runs for the number of elements, and each thread is responsible for a particular i. So, for example, the kernel might look like:

@triton.jit
def kernel(inputs, outputs, N):
    pid = tl.program_id(axis=0)
    i = pid
    # compute input and output values
    # store result

But then, the number of threads per block is determined by the kernel launch. So, for N elements, the kernel is launched with num_blocks = (N + BLOCK_SIZE - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE, and each block processes BLOCK_SIZE elements. Wait, but that would be if each thread processes a block of elements. But in this case, if each thread is responsible for one element, then the number of threads per block is equal to the number of elements per block. So, for example, if the block size is 256, then each block processes 256 elements, and each thread in the block handles one element. But that would require that the number of elements is a multiple of 256. However, Triton can handle dynamic thread counts, so maybe the kernel is written with a loop that runs for the number of elements, and each thread is assigned a unique i.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is written with a loop that runs for the number of elements, and each thread is assigned a unique i. So, for example, in the kernel:

def kernel(inputs, outputs, N):
    pid = tl.program_id(axis=0)
    i = pid
    # compute input and output values
    # store result

But then, the number of threads per block is determined by the number of elements. So, if N is 1000, then the kernel is launched with num_blocks = 1, and each block has 1000 threads. But that might not be efficient, as the block size is limited. So, perhaps the optimal approach is to have each thread process one element, and the block size is determined by the number of elements. But Triton allows for dynamic block sizes, but in practice, the block size is fixed when the kernel is written.

Wait, maybe I should use a block size that is a power of two, and then compute the number of blocks needed.

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that does element-wise addition of two 1D tensors. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is straightforward: for each index i, add the elements from the two input tensors and store the result in the output tensor. But since I'm writing a Triton kernel, I need to consider how to structure the code for GPU parallelism.

Triton kernels use a grid and a block structure. Each thread in the block processes a single element. So, the kernel should iterate over each element in the input tensors. The input tensors are 1D, so each thread will handle one element.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors are 1D, so they are stored in contiguous memory. Each thread will load the value from the input tensors at their respective index, add them, and store the result in the output tensor.

Now, the kernel parameters. The inputs are two tensors (A and B) and an output tensor (C). The size N is the length of the tensors. The kernel needs to process all elements from 0 to N-1.

In Triton, the kernel is written with a @triton.jit decorator. The function will take the pointers to the tensors, the size N, and the block size. The block size is usually a power of two, like 256, but maybe 128 or 256. Let me check the standard practices. Typically, block sizes like 256 are used for better cache utilization.

Each thread in the block will compute a single element. The index for the thread can be calculated as i = pid + offset, where pid is the thread ID within the block. But since the tensors are 1D, each thread will handle one element. So, the loop over the elements is handled by the threads.

Wait, but how do I handle the loop? In Triton, the kernel is written with a loop that iterates over the elements. Each thread will process one element. So, the kernel will have a loop that runs for N elements, and each thread computes one element.

But how to structure that? Let me think. The kernel is called with the number of elements N. Each thread will compute one element. So, the kernel will have a loop that runs for N elements, and each thread will compute one element. But since threads are parallel, each thread will process one element. Wait, but how is that done? Maybe the kernel is structured with a loop that runs for N elements, and each thread is responsible for one element. But that's not efficient because each thread would have to process one element, but with a loop that runs N times. Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured with a loop that runs for the number of elements, and each thread is assigned a unique index.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured with a loop that runs for the number of elements, and each thread is responsible for one element. But how to assign the index to each thread? That's where the thread index comes into play.

Wait, in Triton, each thread has a unique ID within the block. So, for a block of size 256, each thread has an id from 0 to 255. Then, the kernel can compute the index as i = thread_id + block_id * block_size. But since the total number of elements is N, we need to make sure that the threads don't go out of bounds.

So, the kernel would have a loop that runs for N elements, and each thread computes one element. But how to handle that? Maybe the kernel is structured with a loop that runs for N elements, and each thread is responsible for one element. But that's not efficient because each thread would have to process one element, but with a loop that runs N times. Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured with a loop that runs for the number of elements, and each thread is responsible for one element. But that's not efficient because each thread would have to process one element, but with a loop that runs N times. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, the kernel can be written with a loop that runs for the number of elements, and each thread is responsible for one element. But since each thread is in a block, the kernel would have to compute the index for each thread. For example, the kernel would have a loop that runs for N elements, and each thread computes one element. But that's not efficient. Wait, maybe the kernel is structured with a loop that runs for the number of elements, and each thread is responsible for one element. But how?

Alternatively, the kernel can be written with a loop that runs for the number of elements, and each thread is responsible for one element. But how to assign the index to each thread? Let me think. The kernel is called with the number of elements N. The kernel is divided into blocks,

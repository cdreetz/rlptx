Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The user mentioned using tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in Triton.

First, the matrices are A (M x K) and B (K x N). The result C will be (M x N). Each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k in 0 to K-1. But with tile-based computation, I need to break this down into smaller blocks to optimize memory access and utilize shared memory.

In Triton, shared memory is used to store tiles of the matrices. So, I'll need to divide the matrices into blocks of size, say, TILE_M x TILE_K for matrix A and TILE_K x TILE_N for matrix B. Wait, maybe the tile size should be chosen based on the block size. Let me think about the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, the block size is chosen to be a multiple of the warp size (32). So maybe using a block size of 32 or 64. But the exact value depends on the problem.

The key steps are:

1. Determine the block size (BLOCK_SIZE) and tile size (maybe TILE_M, TILE_K, etc.).
2. Load the A and B matrices into shared memory.
3. Compute the dot product of the tiles from A and B.
4. Store the result in the output matrix C.

But how to structure the kernel? The kernel should process each element of C. However, with shared memory, each thread will handle a tile. Wait, maybe each thread block handles a tile of A and B. Let me think again.

In matrix multiplication, each thread block can handle a tile of A and B. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread block can process a tile of size (BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE) for A and B. But I need to make sure that the tiles fit into shared memory.

Wait, the user said tile-based computation with shared memory. So the approach is to split the matrices into tiles, load them into shared memory, compute the dot product, and then write the result back to global memory.

So, the steps for each thread block would be:

- Determine the tile of A and B that this block is responsible for.
- Load the tile of A into shared memory.
- Load the tile of B into shared memory.
- Compute the dot product of the tiles.
- Store the result in the output matrix C.

But how to map the threads to these tiles? Each thread in the block would handle a specific element in the tile. Wait, maybe each thread is responsible for a specific element in the output matrix. But that might not be efficient with shared memory.

Alternatively, each thread block handles a block of rows in A and columns in B. For example, if the block size is 32, each thread block processes a block of size (BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE) for A and (BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE) for B. But I need to adjust the tile sizes based on the block size.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread computes a single element of C. But that would be inefficient because of the memory access patterns. So, the tile-based approach is better.

Let me think about the shared memory. For matrix A (M x K), each tile of size (TILE_M x TILE_K) will be stored in shared memory. Similarly, for matrix B (K x N), each tile of size (TILE_K x TILE_N) is stored in shared memory. Then, the dot product between these tiles is computed.

But how to compute the dot product? For each row in the A tile and column in the B tile, the product is summed. So, the number of elements in the dot product is TILE_K, which is the number of elements in the overlap between A and B.

So, the kernel would have to loop over the elements in the tile, compute the sum, and store it in the corresponding position in the output matrix.

But how to structure this in Triton? Each thread would be responsible for a specific element in the output matrix. However, with shared memory, the threads can load the tiles into shared memory and compute the dot product.

Wait, perhaps the kernel is structured as follows:

Each thread block processes a block of rows in A and columns in B. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread block handles a block of size (BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE) for A and (BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE) for B. But this depends on how the matrices are divided.

Alternatively, the kernel could be structured with each thread handling a specific element in the output matrix. But that would require loading the corresponding elements from A and B, which may not be efficient.

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through the steps.

First, the GPU operations. Matrix multiplication involves computing each element of the resulting matrix as the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix. Since we're using shared memory, I should split the matrices into tiles that fit into the shared memory. The key is to load tiles into shared memory, compute the dot product, and then store the result.

The input tensors are A (M, K) and B (K, N). The output tensor C (M, N) will be the result. For tile-based computation, each tile of A and B will be stored in shared memory. The block size will determine how many elements we process per thread. Typically, a block size of 32 or 64 is used, but I need to choose a value that fits the shared memory and allows efficient computation.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The input tensors are of shape [M, K] and [K, N]. The output is [M, N]. The memory layout is probably row-major, so each row of A is contiguous in memory, same for B and C.

Optimal block sizes: For shared memory, the tile size should be such that the number of elements in the tile fits into the shared memory. Let's say each tile is of size TILE_M x TILE_K for matrix A, and TILE_K x TILE_N for matrix B. But since we're doing matrix multiplication, the tiles need to be compatible. Maybe the block size is determined by the number of elements each thread can process. For example, each thread might handle a small block of elements, but that's more for the inner loop.

Wait, in matrix multiplication, each thread typically computes one element of the result. But with tile-based computation, each thread block processes a tile of the matrices. So, the block size (number of threads per block) would be determined by the tile size. For example, if each tile is of size (TILE_M, TILE_K) for A and (TILE_K, TILE_N) for B, then the number of threads per block would be TILE_M * TILE_K. But I need to check the standard approach.

Alternatively, the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to use a block size that allows each thread to compute a small block of the result. For example, each thread block handles a tile of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K) for A and (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N) for B. The number of threads per block is then BLOCK_M * BLOCK_K. But I need to make sure that the tiles fit into shared memory.

Let me think about the shared memory. For matrix A, each tile is of size (TILE_M, TILE_K), and for B, (TILE_K, TILE_N). The shared memory needs to store these tiles. The size of the shared memory is limited, so the tile sizes should be chosen such that the total size of the tiles is within the available shared memory.

Assuming that each thread block processes a tile of A and B, then the shared memory for A would be TILE_M * TILE_K elements, and for B, TILE_K * TILE_N elements. The total shared memory required is (TILE_M * TILE_K + TILE_K * TILE_N) * sizeof(float). But since the shared memory is limited, we need to choose TILE_M and TILE_K such that this is manageable.

In practice, for a 128-byte shared memory, the tile sizes are often chosen as 16x16 or 32x32. But I need to adjust based on the actual problem. Let's assume that the tile size is 16x16 for A and B. Wait, but for matrix multiplication, the tile size for A and B should be compatible. For example, if A is (M, K), then each tile of A is (TILE_M, TILE_K), and each tile of B is (TILE_K, TILE_N). The number of tiles in each direction depends on the sizes of M, K, N.

But for the kernel, the tile size is determined by the block size. So, the block size is usually chosen as TILE_M * TILE_K. For example, if TILE_M is 16 and TILE_K is 16, then the block size is 256 threads. But I need to make sure that the tile fits into shared memory.

Now, the kernel function. The kernel will process each tile of A and B. Each thread in the block will compute a part of the dot product. Wait, no. In the standard approach, each thread block processes a tile of the result matrix. For example, the block computes a tile of size (BLOCK

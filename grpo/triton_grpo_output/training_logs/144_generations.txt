Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in Triton.

First, the input tensors are A (M x K) and B (K x N). The result is C (M x N), where each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k. But doing this naively would be too slow, so we need to use shared memory and tile-based computation.

In Triton, shared memory is used to store tiles of the input matrices. The idea is to load a block of A and a block of B into shared memory, compute the dot product of the blocks, and store the result in C. The key is to choose the right block size and manage the memory access efficiently.

Let me think about the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 is common. Let's say we use a block size of 32. Each thread will handle a tile of size (block_size x block_size). But how does this fit into the dimensions of A and B?

For each thread, we need to compute the dot product between a row of A and a column of B. However, since we're using shared memory, we need to load chunks of A and B into shared memory. Let me outline the steps:

1. For each thread, determine which tile of A and B it's responsible for.
2. Load the corresponding tile of A into shared memory.
3. Load the corresponding tile of B into shared memory.
4. Compute the dot product of the tiles and store the result in C.

Wait, but how do we handle the indices? Let me think about the indices. Let's assume that each thread is responsible for a certain block of the output matrix. For example, each thread computes a single element of C. But that's not efficient. Alternatively, each thread could compute a block of elements.

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a tile of the output matrix. But that might not be straightforward. Let me think again.

In the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton, each thread is responsible for a single element of the output matrix. But with shared memory, we can load a block of A and B into shared memory, and then compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to have each thread compute a block of the output matrix. For example, each thread handles a tile of size (block_size x block_size) in the output matrix. But I'm not sure. Maybe I should refer to standard Triton matrix multiplication examples.

In standard Triton matrix multiplication, the kernel is structured with each thread handling a single element of the output matrix. However, with shared memory, we can load a block of A and B into shared memory, and then compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B.

Let me think about the shared memory. For matrix A (M x K), each thread will load a block of size (block_size x block_size) into shared memory. Similarly for matrix B (K x N). Then, for each thread, the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B is computed.

Wait, but the dimensions need to align. Let me consider the indices. Let's say that the thread index is i, and the block size is BLOCK_SIZE. Then, for each thread, the row in A is i, and the column in B is j. But how do we compute the dot product?

Alternatively, perhaps each thread is responsible for a block of the output matrix. For example, each thread computes a block of size (BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE) in the output matrix. But I'm getting confused here.

Let me think of the standard approach. The kernel is structured as follows:

- Each thread computes a single element of C[i][j] = sum_{k} A[i][k] * B[k][j].

To do this efficiently, we can load a block of A into shared memory, and a block of B into shared memory. Then, for each thread, we compute the dot product between the row of A and the column of B.

But how to manage the indices. Let me think of the shared memory as follows:

- For matrix A, each thread loads a block of size (BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE) into shared memory. However, since A is M x K, the block size must be such that it fits into the dimensions.

Alternatively, perhaps the shared memory is used to store tiles of A and B. For example, each thread is responsible for a tile of A and a tile of B, and computes the dot product between them.

But I need to make sure that the shared memory is properly aligned. Let me try

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in Triton.

First, the problem is to compute C = A * B, where A is MxK and B is KxN. The result C will be MxN. Each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for k from 0 to K-1.

In Triton, I need to use shared memory to store tiles of the input matrices to avoid repeated global memory accesses. The tile size is usually a parameter, maybe 128 or 256 elements. Let's pick 128 for this example.

So, the steps would be:

1. For each block of rows in A and columns in B, load the tiles into shared memory.
2. Multiply the tiles and accumulate the result into C.
3. Use proper memory access patterns to ensure coalescing and avoid bank conflicts.

First, I need to determine the block size. Let's say each thread block processes a tile of size TILE_M x TILE_K for A and TILE_K x TILE_N for B. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of how many elements each thread can handle. Alternatively, the block size could be determined by the number of elements each thread can process in a single iteration.

But in matrix multiplication, each thread usually handles one element of the result. However, with shared memory, we can process tiles. Let me think about the standard approach.

In the standard matrix multiplication with shared memory, each thread block handles a block of A and B. For example, if the tile size is TILE_M x TILE_K for A, and TILE_K x TILE_N for B, then each thread block would process a portion of the matrix. But how to structure this in Triton?

Alternatively, each thread could be responsible for computing a single element of C. But with shared memory, we can load tiles of A and B into shared memory, then perform the multiplication in shared memory, and then write the result back to global memory.

Wait, but for large K, this might not be efficient. So, using tile-based computation, we can divide the matrices into tiles, and each thread block processes a tile of A and a tile of B, then compute the product.

But maybe the standard approach is to have each thread block process a block of rows in A and columns in B. For example, if the tile size is TILE_M rows in A and TILE_K columns in B, then each thread block handles a TILE_M x TILE_K tile of A and a TILE_K x TILE_N tile of B. Then, each thread in the block would compute a part of the result.

Alternatively, perhaps each thread block processes a block of rows in A and a block of columns in B. For example, if the tile size is TILE_M rows in A and TILE_N columns in B, then each thread block handles a TILE_M x TILE_N block of C. But that's more for the result.

But in this case, since A is MxK and B is KxN, the result is MxN. So, each thread block would need to handle a block of rows in A (say, TILE_M rows) and a block of columns in B (TILE_N columns), and compute the corresponding block of C.

But how to structure the threads. Let's think of the kernel as processing each element of C. Each thread would compute one element of C. But with shared memory, we can load the corresponding rows of A and columns of B into shared memory, then compute the sum.

But for large K, this would be inefficient. So, using tile-based computation, we can load tiles of A and B into shared memory, then compute the product in shared memory, and then write the result back to global memory.

Let me think about the steps:

1. Each thread block processes a tile of A (say, TILE_M rows and TILE_K columns) and a tile of B (TILE_K rows and TILE_N columns). But since B is KxN, each tile of B would be TILE_K rows and TILE_N columns. However, the tile size for B is determined by how we split the K dimension.

Alternatively, the tile size for A is TILE_M rows and TILE_K columns, and for B, it's TILE_K rows and TILE_N columns. Then, each thread block would handle a block of rows in A (TILE_M rows) and a block of columns in B (TILE_N columns), and compute the corresponding block of C (TILE_M x TILE_N).

But how to structure the threads. Each thread would be responsible for a particular element in the block of C. For example, in the block of C, each thread computes one element. So,

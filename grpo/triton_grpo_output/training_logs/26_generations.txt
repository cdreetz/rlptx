Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum each column of the tensor. So for each column (which is the last dimension), we need to add up all the elements in that column. The input is a 2D tensor with M rows and N columns. The output should be a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the sum of the corresponding column.

Next, input and output tensor shapes. The input is [M, N], and the output is [M]. The memory layout should be contiguous in the tensor. For Triton, the kernel will process elements in blocks, so I need to figure out how to iterate over the columns and sum each column.

Optimal block sizes and memory access patterns. Since we're summing along the last dimension, each thread should handle a single column. But how to organize the threads? Maybe each threadblock handles a single column. Wait, but if the number of columns is large, maybe we need to have multiple threadblocks. Alternatively, each threadblock could process multiple columns, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, each threadblock could handle a single column, and the number of threadblocks is equal to the number of columns. But that might not be efficient if N is large. Alternatively, maybe each threadblock processes a range of columns. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of how many elements each thread can process.

Wait, the kernel needs to process each column. Let's think about the threads. Each thread can be responsible for a single column. So for each column, we need to sum all the elements in that column. So the kernel will have to iterate over each column, and for each column, sum all the elements in that column.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let's think about the grid and blocks. The grid size would be determined by the number of columns. Each threadblock would handle one column. But how to compute the grid size. For example, if there are N columns, then the grid size would be N. But if N is large, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each threadblock processes multiple columns. But that might complicate the code. Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed to process each column in a way that each threadblock handles a single column.

Wait, but for a 2D tensor, each column is a vector of M elements. So for each column, we need to sum M elements. So the number of threads per column would be the number of elements in the column, which is M. But that's not efficient. Alternatively, we can use a block size that can process multiple elements in parallel. For example, using a block size of 1024, and each threadblock processes a certain number of elements in the column.

Wait, but the problem is that each column has M elements. So if M is large, say 1000, then each threadblock can process a certain number of elements in the column. But how to structure this. Let's think of the kernel as processing each column, and for each column, summing all elements. So for each column, the threads in the threadblock can process a range of elements in that column.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel can be structured such that each threadblock handles a single column. So for each column, the threads in the threadblock process the elements in that column. But how to compute the grid size. The grid size would be the number of columns, N. Each threadblock would handle one column. Then, for each column, the threads in the threadblock would process the elements in that column. But how to split the elements in the column among the threads in the threadblock.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed to process each column, and for each column, the threads in the threadblock process a range of elements in that column. For example, using a block size of 1024, and each threadblock processes a certain number of elements in the column. But this might be complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed to process each element in the column, and for each element, accumulate the sum. But that would require a lot of threads, but perhaps with a block size that can handle multiple elements in parallel.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is designed to compute the sum for each column by having each threadblock handle a single column, and each thread in the threadblock handles a single element in that column. But then, for each column, the number of threads would be M. But if M is large, that would require a lot of threads. However, Triton can handle that.

But perhaps the optimal way is to have each threadblock process a single column, and each thread in the threadblock handles a single element in that column.

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum each column of the matrix. So for each column (which is the last dimension), we need to add up all the elements in that column. The input is a 2D tensor with M rows and N columns. The output should be a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the sum of the corresponding column.

Next, input and output tensor shapes. The input is [M, N], and the output is [M]. The memory layout is probably row-major, so each row is stored contiguously. For a 2D tensor, the element at row i, column j is at position i*N + j in the underlying array. But in Triton, when we access the tensor, we can use the strides to get the correct index.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels typically use a grid of blocks, each processing a portion of the data. For a sum reduction along the last dimension, each block should handle a single column. But since each column has M elements, the number of blocks needed would be N, but that might not be efficient. Wait, no. Wait, the problem is to sum along the last dimension, which is columns. So each column is a separate reduction. But if we have N columns, each with M elements, then each block can handle one column. However, for a 2D tensor, the columns are stored in a way that each column is spread across the rows. So for each column j, the elements are at positions (0, j), (1, j), ..., (M-1, j). So in terms of memory, for a given column j, the index in the underlying array is i*N + j for row i. Wait, no. Wait, if the tensor is stored as a 1D array, then for a 2D tensor with shape [M, N], the element at (i, j) is at position i*N + j. So for a column j, the elements are at positions 0*N + j, 1*N + j, ..., (M-1)*N + j. So each column is stored in a contiguous block of M elements, but spaced by N elements. Wait, no. Wait, if the tensor is stored in row-major order, then each row is contiguous. So for row i, the elements are at positions i*N, i*N + 1, ..., i*N + N-1. So for column j, the elements are at positions 0*N + j, 1*N + j, ..., (M-1)*N + j. So each column is not contiguous in memory. Therefore, when accessing elements in a column, we need to calculate the correct index for each row.

But in Triton, when we have a tensor, we can use the strides to access elements. For example, if the tensor is of shape [M, N], then the stride for the first dimension (rows) is N, and the stride for the second dimension (columns) is 1. So, for a given row i and column j, the index is i * N + j. But in the kernel, we need to process each column. So for each column j, we need to sum all elements in that column. So for each block, we can process one column. But how to handle that.

Alternatively, perhaps we can process each row. Wait, no. The sum is along the last dimension (columns), so each column is summed. So for each column j, sum over i from 0 to M-1 the value at (i, j).

So the kernel needs to process each column. But how to structure the blocks. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The kernel will take the input tensor, the output tensor, and the dimensions M and N.

In Triton, the kernel is written with a grid and a block. For each block, we can assign a column index. Then, for each column, we need to sum all the elements in that column. So for each block, we can process one column. But how to handle the rows.

But if the kernel is processing columns, then each block can be responsible for a single column. The number of blocks would be N. But that's not efficient. Wait, but if the kernel is written to process each column, then each block can handle one column. So for each column j, the block processes all rows i from 0 to M-1, summing the value at (i, j).

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows. So perhaps the kernel is structured as follows: for each column j, the block processes all rows i, and accum

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should recall how matrix multiplication works. The standard approach is to compute each element of the resulting matrix as the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix. But with large matrices, this would be too slow without optimizations. So, using shared memory and tiling is essential here.

Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for GPU parallelism. The key steps would be:

1. **Determine the GPU operations**: We need to perform element-wise multiplications and summations for each element in the resulting matrix. The two input matrices are [M, K] and [K, N], so the output will be [M, N].

2. **Input/Output Tensor Shapes**: The first matrix (A) has dimensions M x K, the second (B) is K x N. The output (C) will be M x N. Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

3. **Optimal Block Sizes and Memory Access**: Using shared memory, we can tile the matrices. A common approach is to use a block size that allows for efficient memory access. For example, using a block size of 32 or 64 elements. The idea is to load chunks of the matrices into shared memory, compute the dot product in the block, and then write the result back to global memory.

4. **Edge Cases**: Handling cases where the matrix dimensions are not perfectly divisible by the block size. Also, ensuring that the shared memory is properly managed, and that we don't access out-of-bounds elements. Masking might be needed if some elements are not computed due to the tile size.

Now, let's think about the kernel structure. The kernel will need to process each element of the output matrix. Each thread in the kernel will handle a specific element (i, j) in the output. But with shared memory, we need to load the relevant rows and columns into shared memory.

Wait, actually, in matrix multiplication, each thread block can compute a block of the output matrix. But for the tile-based approach, each thread block might handle a tile of the output. However, since the problem states to use tile-based computation with shared memory, I need to structure the kernel so that each thread block processes a tile of the matrices.

Alternatively, perhaps each thread is responsible for computing a single element of the output matrix. But that would be inefficient. So, the standard approach is to use a block size that allows for computing multiple elements in parallel.

Wait, maybe the standard approach is to have each thread block compute a block of the output matrix. For example, each thread block handles a tile of size (block_size, block_size) in the output matrix. But given that the input matrices are of size M x K and K x N, the tile size would depend on the block size.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread block processes a portion of the matrices. Let me think again.

In the standard matrix multiplication with shared memory, each thread block loads a block of A (say, of size K x block_size) into shared memory, and a block of B (block_size x K) into shared memory. Then, each thread in the block computes a part of the dot product. But this is more for when the matrices are large and you want to process them in tiles.

But given that the problem says to use tile-based computation with shared memory, I think the standard approach is to use a block size that allows for efficient computation. For example, using a block size of 32, and each thread block handles a tile of the matrices.

But perhaps I need to structure the kernel such that each thread is responsible for computing a single element of the output matrix. However, that's not efficient. So, the better approach is to use a block size that allows for multiple elements to be computed in parallel.

Alternatively, the kernel might be designed to compute a block of the output matrix. For example, each thread block computes a block of size (block_size, block_size) in the output matrix. But this depends on the specific dimensions.

But given that the input matrices are M x K and K x N, the output is M x N. So, the kernel needs to compute each element C[i][j] as the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

So, the kernel would have to iterate over all i and j, but with shared memory, we can load the necessary elements of A and B into shared memory.

Wait, but in the standard approach, each thread block handles a tile of the matrices. For example, if the block size is 3

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The user specified using tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through the steps.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first matrix is MxK, the second is KxN, so the result should be MxN. Each element in the result is the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix.

In Triton, I need to use shared memory to optimize memory access. The idea is to load tiles of the matrices into shared memory, then perform the multiplication and accumulation in shared memory, and finally store the result back to global memory.

So, the kernel will have to handle multiple tiles. Let me think about the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 is common. Let's say I choose 32 elements per thread. But I need to make sure that the threads can handle the tiles properly.

Each thread will compute a single element of the result matrix. But with shared memory, each thread can compute a block of elements. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of tiles. For example, each thread block handles a tile of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K) for the first matrix and (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N) for the second matrix. But I need to adjust this based on the actual matrix dimensions.

Wait, the standard approach is to split the matrices into tiles. Each thread block handles a tile of the first matrix (M x K) and a tile of the second matrix (K x N). But since the matrices are of size MxK and KxN, the tile size needs to be chosen such that the threads can compute the dot product efficiently.

Let me think about the shared memory. The first matrix (A) will be stored in shared memory as a 2D array. Similarly for the second matrix (B). The result matrix (C) will be stored in shared memory as well, but since each thread computes one element, maybe the shared memory is used for temporary storage during the computation.

Wait, no. In standard matrix multiplication with shared memory, each thread block computes a block of the result matrix. For example, if the block size is 32x32, then each thread block handles a 32x32 tile of the result. But in this case, the matrices are MxK and KxN, so the result is MxN. So the block size would be such that each thread block can compute a block of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N) in the result.

But perhaps I should use the standard approach where each thread block computes a tile of the result matrix. Let me recall the standard Triton matrix multiplication code.

In the standard case, each thread block handles a tile of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N) in the result. The first matrix is split into tiles of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K), and the second into (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N). The threads in the block compute the dot product between the corresponding rows and columns of the tiles.

So, for the first matrix A (MxK), each thread block will process a tile of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K). Similarly for B (KxN), each tile is (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N). The result matrix C is (MxN), and each thread block computes a tile of (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N).

But the problem is that the matrices might not be perfectly divisible by the block size. So I need to handle that with proper indexing and masking.

So, the steps for the kernel would be:

1. For each thread block, determine the tile of A and B that it is responsible for.
2. Load the tile of A into shared memory.
3. Load the tile of B into shared memory.
4. Compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B, accumulating the result into the corresponding tile of C.
5. Store the result back to global memory.

But how to structure this in Triton?

Each thread in the block will handle a specific element in the result matrix. Wait, no. In the standard approach, each thread block computes a block of the result matrix. For example, if the block size is 32x32, then each thread block handles a 32x32 tile of the result. Each thread in the block is responsible for computing one element of that tile.

But how does that work with the shared memory? Let me think again.

In the standard approach, each thread block processes a tile of the result matrix. The tile is divided into rows and columns. Each thread in the block computes one element of the result tile. The threads in the block are arranged in a grid of rows and columns, where each thread computes one element.

But for matrix multiplication, the threads need to compute the dot product

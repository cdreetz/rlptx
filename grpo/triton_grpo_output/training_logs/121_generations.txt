Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in Triton.

First, the input tensors are A (M x K) and B (K x N). The result is C (M x N), where each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k. But doing this naively would be slow, so we need to use shared memory and tile-based computation.

In Triton, each thread block processes a tile of the matrix. So, I need to determine the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 is common. Let's say I choose 32 elements per thread. But wait, the block size should be a multiple of the number of elements in each dimension. Maybe 32 is okay.

Next, the shared memory. Each thread block will load a tile of A and B into shared memory. The tiles should be of size (block_size, block_size). But since A is M x K and B is K x N, the tiles need to be compatible. For example, if the block size is 32, then each tile of A is 32x32, and each tile of B is 32x32. However, since K might be larger than the block size, we need to process multiple tiles.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the tile size. Let's define TILE_M and TILE_N as the number of rows and columns in each tile. But since the matrices are A (M,K) and B (K,N), the tiles for A would be TILE_M x TILE_K, and for B would be TILE_K x TILE_N. But the actual tile size depends on how we split the matrices into tiles. Maybe I should use a block size of 32, and split the matrices into tiles of size (32, 32). However, the K dimension is the same for both A and B, so the tiles for A and B must be compatible.

Wait, the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to use a block size that's a multiple of the number of elements in each dimension. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread block processes a tile of size (32, 32) for A and (32, 32) for B. However, since the K dimension is the same for both A and B, the tiles for A and B must be aligned such that their K dimension is compatible.

Alternatively, maybe the block size is 32, and each thread block handles a tile of A (size TILE_M x TILE_K) and a tile of B (size TILE_K x TILE_N). But how do I choose TILE_M and TILE_K? Well, TILE_K should be the same for both A and B. So, perhaps TILE_K is 32, and TILE_M is 32. Then, for each tile of A, we take 32 rows and 32 columns, and for B, 32 columns and 32 rows.

But the problem is that the K dimension might not be a multiple of the block size. So, we need to handle that with masking. Also, the output matrix C is M x N, so each thread block will compute a portion of C.

So, the steps would be:

1. For each thread block, determine which portion of A and B it is responsible for.
2. Load the corresponding tiles of A and B into shared memory.
3. Perform the matrix multiplication on the shared memory tiles.
4. Write the result back to global memory.

But how to structure the threads in the block? Each thread in the block would handle a particular element in the tile. For example, in the tile of A, each thread would process a row of A and a column of B. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

In standard matrix multiplication, each thread block processes a tile of A and a tile of B. The threads within the block are responsible for computing the dot product between a row of A and a column of B. So, for each thread in the block, the thread index determines which element of the tile it is responsible for.

But since the block size is 32, the block will have 32 threads. Wait, no. The block size in Triton is determined by the number of threads per block. For example, if the block size is 32, then there are 32 threads in the block. But each thread would handle a single element in the tile. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I should think of the block as processing a tile of size (TILE_M, TILE_N

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through the steps.

First, the GPU operations. Matrix multiplication involves computing each element of the resulting matrix as the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix. Since we're using shared memory, I should split the matrices into tiles that fit into shared memory. The key is to load the tiles into shared memory, compute the dot product, and then store the result.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The first matrix is M x K, the second is K x N. The output will be M x N. So, for each element in the output matrix, we need to compute the sum over K elements of (A[i][k] * B[k][j]).

Now, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels typically use a block size that's a multiple of 32. Let's choose 32 as the block size. Each thread will handle a tile of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). But wait, for matrix multiplication, the tiles are usually (K, K) for the two matrices. So maybe the block size should be set to K, but since K can vary, perhaps we need to use a dynamic block size. However, in Triton, the block size is fixed per kernel. So maybe we need to choose a block size that's a multiple of 32, say 128, and use tiling.

Wait, the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to split the matrices into tiles of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), where BLOCK_SIZE is 32 or 128. Let me recall. For example, in the standard Triton matrix multiplication example, they use a block size of 128, and each thread block handles a tile of size 128x128. But in this case, the matrices are M x K and K x N. So, the tile size for the first matrix (A) would be (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), and for the second matrix (B) also (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). But since K is the dimension that's being multiplied, the tiles would be of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) for each matrix.

But the actual tile size depends on the problem. Let me think. The first matrix is M x K. So, each tile of A would be of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), but if K is smaller than BLOCK_SIZE, then the tile would be (K, BLOCK_SIZE). Similarly for B. However, since we're using shared memory, we need to load the tiles into shared memory. So, the shared memory for A would be of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), and same for B.

Wait, but the problem says to use tile-based computation with shared memory. So, the idea is that each thread block loads a tile of A and a tile of B into shared memory, computes the dot product for the corresponding elements in the output matrix, and then stores the result.

But how to structure the threads. Let me think about the threads per block. Each thread block will handle a tile of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) in the output matrix. Wait, no. The output matrix is M x N. So, each thread block would be responsible for computing a block of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) in the output matrix. But that might not be the case. Alternatively, each thread block could compute a tile of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) in the output matrix, but that depends on how the tiles are split.

Alternatively, the standard approach is that each thread block computes a tile of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) in the output matrix. So, the output matrix is divided into tiles of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), and each thread block handles one such tile. But how does that relate to the input matrices?

Alternatively, for the input matrices A (M x K) and B (K x N), each thread block would process a tile of A and a tile of B. For example, if the block size is 128, then each thread block would handle a tile of A of size (128, 128) and a tile of B of size (128, 128). However, if K is smaller than 128, then the tile would be (K, 128), but that might not fit. So, the block size is chosen such that it's a multiple of 32, and the tile size is (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE).

But perhaps the correct approach is to split the matrices into tiles of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), and for each tile in A and B, compute the dot product for

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by understanding what the problem requires.

First, matrix multiplication between a MxK matrix and a KxN matrix results in a MxN matrix. So, the kernel needs to compute each element (i, j) as the sum of the products of the i-th row of the first matrix and the j-th column of the second matrix.

Now, considering Triton's capabilities, I should think about how to structure the kernel. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows for efficient parallelism. The kernel will be written in a way that leverages warp-level parallelism and efficient memory access.

Let me break down the steps:

1. **GPU Operations**: The kernel needs to perform element-wise multiplications and summations. Each thread will compute one element of the resulting matrix. However, since K can be large, I need to optimize the loop over K.

2. **Tensor Shapes and Memory Layout**: The input tensors are [M, K] and [K, N]. The output tensor is [M, N]. The memory layout should be contiguous for efficient access. Assuming the inputs are stored in row-major order, each row of the first matrix is contiguous, and each column of the second matrix is contiguous.

3. **Block Sizes and Memory Access**: For each thread, I need to process a particular (i, j) pair. The thread index can be determined by the block and thread indices. The block size should be chosen to maximize occupancy. Typically, a block size of 128 or 256 is common, but I need to check if that fits the problem.

   However, since each thread is responsible for a single element in the output matrix, the number of threads per block would be M * N. But that's not feasible for large M and N. Wait, that's not right. Wait, no. Wait, for matrix multiplication, each thread typically computes one element. But if M and N are large, this would require a huge number of threads. So perhaps a better approach is to use a block size that can process multiple elements in parallel, but that depends on the problem.

   Alternatively, perhaps using a block size of 128, and each thread computes a single element. But for that, the number of threads per block would be M * N, which is not feasible. So maybe I need to structure the kernel in a way that each thread block handles a portion of the matrix.

   Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element of the result. So, for each element (i, j), the thread would compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. But for that, each thread would need to iterate over K elements. However, if K is large, this would be slow. So, to optimize, we can use a block size that allows for multiple k's to be processed in parallel. But how?

   Alternatively, using a block size that is a multiple of K, so that each thread can process a chunk of K elements. But that might complicate the indexing.

   Wait, perhaps the standard approach for Triton matrix multiplication is to have each thread compute one element of the result, and for each element, loop over K. But with K possibly being large, this could be slow. So, perhaps using a block size that allows for multiple threads to work on the same i and j, but that might not be straightforward.

   Alternatively, considering that the matrix multiplication can be optimized by using a block size that allows for multiple elements to be computed in parallel. For example, using a block size of 128, and each thread handles a certain number of k's. But I need to think about how to structure the loops.

   Let me think again. The kernel needs to compute C[i][j] = sum_{k=0}^{K-1} A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, for each i and j, the thread needs to iterate over k. However, if K is large, this loop could be slow. So, perhaps using a block size that allows for multiple k's to be processed in parallel. For example, if the block size is 128, then each thread can process a certain number of k's, but that would require the block to have multiple threads working on different k's for the same i and j.

   Alternatively, perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element, and the loop over k is done in the kernel. So, the kernel would have a loop over k, and each thread would compute the product and accumulate the sum. But for that, the number of threads per block would be M * N, which is not feasible for large M and N. Therefore, this approach is not suitable for large matrices.

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by understanding what's required here.

First, matrix multiplication between a MxK matrix and a KxN matrix results in a MxN matrix. So the output tensor will have shape [M, N]. The kernel needs to compute each element of this resulting matrix.

Now, thinking about how Triton works. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA. The kernel will process elements in blocks, and each block will handle a portion of the computation.

The key steps are:

1. Determine the dimensions of the problem. The first matrix (A) has shape [M, K], the second (B) has [K, N]. The result (C) is [M, N].

2. Decide on the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 is common. Let's choose 32 for this example, but maybe 64 is better for larger K. Wait, but the block size depends on how we split the problem. For each block, we can process a certain number of rows and columns.

3. Memory layout: The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. So for a block, we need to access elements in A and B in a way that allows for coalesced memory access.

4. For each element C[i][j], it's the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for k from 0 to K-1. So each thread in the block will compute one element of the result matrix.

But how to structure this in Triton? Each thread will handle a specific (i, j) pair. However, in matrix multiplication, it's more efficient to have each thread compute a single element, but that might not be the most efficient in terms of memory access. Alternatively, we can use a more efficient approach where each thread computes multiple elements, but that depends on the block size and how we split the problem.

Wait, in standard matrix multiplication, each thread computes one element. But for large K, this can be slow because each thread has to perform K operations. So maybe using a more efficient approach where each thread computes multiple elements by using a block that processes a certain number of rows and columns.

Alternatively, the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element. Let me think about the block size. Let's say each block handles a certain number of rows and columns. For example, if the block size is 32, then each block can handle 32 rows and 32 columns. But how does that fit into the problem?

Alternatively, each thread in the block handles a specific (i, j) pair. So for the output matrix C, each thread is responsible for computing C[i][j]. The problem is that for each element, the thread has to loop through K elements (the k indices) and sum the products. However, this could be slow if K is large. But Triton is optimized for this kind of loop, so maybe it's acceptable.

But in Triton, the kernel is written in a way that each thread handles a specific part of the computation. So the kernel will have to loop over the K elements for each (i, j) pair.

So the steps for the kernel would be:

- For each thread, compute the row i and column j in the output matrix C.
- For each k in 0 to K-1, compute A[i][k] * B[k][j], and accumulate the sum.

But how to handle the indices? Let's think about the thread indices. The kernel will have a grid of threads, and each thread will be responsible for a specific (i, j) pair.

But how to map the thread index to i and j? Let's say that the grid is divided into blocks, and each block handles a certain number of rows and columns. For example, if the block size is 32, then each block will handle 32 rows and 32 columns. But that might not be the case. Alternatively, each thread in the block is responsible for a specific (i, j) pair.

Wait, perhaps the kernel is structured as follows:

- The grid is divided into blocks, each block handles a certain number of rows (M) and columns (N). But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, each thread is responsible for a single element in the output matrix.

But for the kernel, the thread index can be mapped to i and j. For example, the thread index in the grid is (thread_id_x, thread_id_y), and each thread is responsible for (i, j) where i = thread_id_y and j = thread_id_x. Wait, but that's not correct. Let me think again.

In Triton, the kernel is

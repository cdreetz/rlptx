Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is to find the minimum value in each row of a 2D tensor. Each row is of length N, and there are M rows. So for each row, I need to compute the minimum of N elements.

Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for parallelism. So I need to figure out how to structure the kernel to process each row efficiently.

Let me consider the input tensor. It's a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Now, the kernel needs to process each row. So the first thing is to determine the block size. Since each row has N elements, and each block can process a certain number of elements, I need to choose a block size that's efficient. Typically, for such reductions, a block size of 256 is common, but maybe I can adjust it based on N.

Wait, but for each row, the reduction is along the last dimension. So each thread in the block would handle a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction across the threads in the block.

Wait, no. Wait, for a reduction along the last dimension (N), each row is processed. So for each row, the threads in the block would process the elements in that row, and compute the minimum.

But how to structure this. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The input tensor is of shape [M, N], and the output is [M]. So each thread will be responsible for a single row. Wait, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, each thread could handle a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction across the threads in the block.

Wait, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each block processes one row. So for each row, the block processes all N elements in that row, and computes the minimum. But how to do that in Triton.

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then the threads in the block perform a reduction to find the minimum. That's a common approach for reductions.

So, for each row, we have N elements. The block size should be such that each block can handle the reduction. For example, if the block size is 256, then each block can process up to 256 elements in a row. But if N is smaller than 256, then the threads in the block would process the elements, and then the reduction would be done across the threads.

But how to structure the kernel. Let me think about the steps:

1. For each row in the input tensor, compute the minimum of its elements.
2. The output tensor will have one element per row.

So, the kernel needs to iterate over each row. For each row, process all elements in that row, and compute the minimum.

In Triton, the kernel is launched with a grid of blocks. Each block can process one row. So the grid size would be M blocks, each processing one row.

But how to handle the threads in the block. For each row, the number of elements is N. So the threads in the block would be responsible for processing elements in that row. For example, if the block size is 256, then each block has 256 threads. Each thread would handle a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction across the threads.

Wait, but that's not efficient if N is smaller than the block size. So perhaps the block size should be chosen such that each block can handle the entire row. But that's not possible if N is variable. So maybe the block size is set to 256, and for each row, the threads in the block process the elements in that row, and then reduce to find the minimum.

So the steps for each block would be:

- For a given row, each thread in the block is responsible for a single element in that row.
- The threads in the block perform a reduction to find the minimum of all elements in the row.

But how to map the thread indices to the elements in the row. Let's think: for a given row, the elements are in the input tensor at positions [row, 0], [row, 1], ..., [row, N-1]. So for a thread in the block, the index in the row would be determined by the thread's index within the block.

But how to handle this. Let's think of the kernel parameters. The input tensor is a 2D tensor, and the output is a 1D tensor. The kernel needs to process each row.

So, the kernel function would be something

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the min reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the minimum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor). So for each row (each M element), I need to find the minimum among the N elements in that row.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels typically use a grid and block structure. For this problem, each block can process a single row. Since each row has N elements, the number of blocks needed would be M. But since each block can handle one row, the block size should be such that each thread can process a single element in the row. Wait, but maybe it's better to have each thread handle one element in the row. However, since we need to find the min, perhaps each thread can compare elements and track the minimum.

Wait, but for a min reduction, a common approach is to have each thread handle a portion of the data. But in this case, since the reduction is along the last dimension (N), each row is processed independently. So for each row, we can have a reduction over the N elements. But how to structure the threads for that.

Alternatively, for each row, we can have a thread per element, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, we can have a block that processes a row, with multiple threads working on the elements of that row to find the minimum.

Let me think about the block size. Let's say each block handles one row. Then, each block has multiple threads that process the elements of that row. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block can process up to 128 elements in a row. But since each row has N elements, we need to make sure that the block can process the entire row. But if N is larger than the block size, then multiple blocks would be needed per row. Wait, but if each block is responsible for one row, then each block would have to process all elements of that row. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each block can process a portion of the row, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, for each row, we can have a reduction. For example, each thread in the block handles a portion of the row's elements, and then the threads combine their results. But how to structure that.

Alternatively, since the reduction is along the last dimension, for each row, we can have a reduction over N elements. So for each row, the number of elements is N. The standard approach for a reduction is to have threads in a warp work on the elements, and then combine the results. But in this case, each row is processed independently. So perhaps the grid is made of M blocks, each handling a row. Each block then performs a reduction on the N elements of that row.

But how to structure the threads. For each block, the threads can be arranged in a way that they process the elements of the row. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block can process up to 128 elements. But if N is larger than 128, then multiple blocks would be needed per row. Wait, but that's not possible because each block is responsible for one row. So perhaps the block size should be such that each block can process the entire row. But that's not feasible if N is larger than the block size. So perhaps the block size is chosen such that each block can process the row's elements in a way that allows for efficient reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps each thread in the block is responsible for a single element in the row. Then, the block can perform a reduction over the elements. But that would require that the number of threads in the block is equal to N, which could be large. But since N can be up to, say, 1024, and block size is 128, then for N=1024, we would need 8 threads per block. But that's manageable.

Wait, but for each row, the number of elements is N. So for each row, the threads in the block would process the elements of that row. So for a row with N elements, the number of threads per block would be N. But that's not feasible if N is large. So perhaps the block size is chosen as a power of two, and the threads in the block work in a way that they can reduce the elements.

Alternatively, the block can be responsible for a single row, and each thread in

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by understanding what's required here.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first matrix is MxK, the second is KxN, so the result should be MxN. Each element in the output is the sum of the products of elements from the rows of the first matrix and columns of the second matrix.

Now, thinking about how to implement this in Triton. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA, but with more flexibility and better performance. The key is to structure the kernel to efficiently use the GPU's resources, like registers and memory.

Let me break down the steps:

1. **GPU Operations**: The kernel needs to perform element-wise multiplications and summations. For each element in the output matrix, we need to compute the dot product between a row of the first matrix and a column of the second matrix.

2. **Tensor Shapes and Memory Layout**: The input tensors are [M, K] and [K, N]. The output is [M, N]. Assuming they are stored in row-major order, which is standard. So, for the first matrix, each row is contiguous in memory. Similarly for the second matrix.

3. **Block Sizes and Memory Access**: Triton uses warps and threads per warp. A common approach is to use a block size that's a multiple of 32 (since a warp has 32 threads). For matrix multiplication, a common block size is 128 or 256. But since K can be large, maybe a block size of 128 is manageable. However, the exact block size depends on the problem's dimensions. But for this problem, let's assume a block size of 128, which is a common choice.

4. **Memory Access Patterns**: To optimize memory access, we need to ensure that each thread accesses elements in a coalesced manner. For the first matrix (A), each thread can process a row, and for the second matrix (B), each thread processes a column. However, since K can be large, we need to manage how many elements each thread processes. For example, if K is 1024, then each thread might process 8 elements (since 128 threads per block, 1024 / 128 = 8). But this depends on the block size and the K value.

Wait, but in matrix multiplication, each thread typically handles one element of the output. However, with a block size of 128, each block can handle multiple elements. Alternatively, perhaps using a block size of 128, and each thread is responsible for a particular element in the output. But that might not be efficient for large K. Alternatively, using a block size that allows for multiple elements per thread.

Alternatively, the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to use a block size of 128, and each thread computes a single element of the output. But that might not be optimal for large K. However, in this case, since the matrices are MxK and KxN, the number of elements in the output is M*N. So, for each element in the output, the thread needs to compute the sum over K elements.

But that would require each thread to process K elements, which could be expensive. So perhaps a better approach is to split the computation into blocks where each block handles a portion of K. For example, if K is large, each thread can process a subset of the K elements, and the block can handle multiple elements. But I need to think about how to structure this.

Wait, maybe I should look up standard Triton matrix multiplication examples. In standard matrix multiplication, each thread computes one element of the output. So, for each element (i,j) in the output, the thread computes sum_{k} A[i][k] * B[k][j]. But for large K, this would be slow. However, with Triton's ability to use shared memory, we can optimize this by loading the relevant rows and columns into shared memory.

But the user hasn't mentioned using shared memory. So maybe the kernel is supposed to be implemented without shared memory, using global memory. However, that's not efficient. But perhaps the problem is to write the kernel in a way that is as efficient as possible, even if it's not using shared memory. Alternatively, maybe the kernel is intended to be written with shared memory.

Wait, the user just said to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication. So, perhaps the standard approach is to use shared memory to cache the relevant parts of the matrices. But the problem is, the user hasn't specified whether to use shared memory or not. However, in a Triton kernel, it's common to use

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to compute C = A * B, where A is MxK and B is KxN. The result C should be MxN. So each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. 

Now, Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for GPU parallelism. I need to figure out how to structure the kernel to handle this efficiently. 

Let me recall how matrix multiplication is typically handled in Triton. Usually, each thread block handles a block of rows from the first matrix (A) and a block of columns from the second matrix (B), and computes the corresponding elements in the result matrix (C). But since the matrices are of different dimensions, I need to make sure that the block sizes and memory accesses are optimized.

First, the input tensors: A has shape [M, K], B has shape [K, N]. The output C will be [M, N]. 

In Triton, each thread block is responsible for computing a submatrix of C. The block size is usually chosen to be a power of two, like 256. But I need to decide how to split the rows and columns. For matrix multiplication, each thread block can handle a certain number of rows from A and columns from B. However, since K might not be a multiple of the block size, I need to handle that with masking or proper indexing.

Wait, but in matrix multiplication, each thread in the block typically handles a single element of the result. So for each element C[i][j], the thread computes the dot product of the i-th row of A and the j-th column of B. But that's not efficient because each thread would have to compute K elements. Instead, a more efficient approach is to have each thread block compute a block of elements in C, using a block size that allows for efficient memory access.

Alternatively, in the standard approach, each thread block handles a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. For example, if the block size is 32, then each block handles 32 rows of A and 32 columns of B, and computes the corresponding elements in C. But this depends on the actual dimensions of the matrices.

But for the general case, maybe I should structure the kernel such that each thread block handles a certain number of rows (M) and columns (N), but that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, using a more standard approach where each thread computes a single element of C, but with optimized memory access patterns.

Wait, in the standard matrix multiplication, each thread computes a single element of C, which is the dot product of a row of A and a column of B. However, this approach can be slow because each thread has to access K elements. To optimize, we can use a block size that allows for multiple elements to be computed in parallel. But perhaps that's more complex.

Alternatively, the standard approach for Triton is to have each thread block handle a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. For example, each block handles a block of size (block_rows, block_cols), and each thread in the block computes a single element of C. But this requires that the block size is chosen such that the number of threads per block is block_rows * block_cols. However, this might not be efficient for all cases.

Alternatively, perhaps using a more optimized approach where each thread block handles a block of K elements, but that's not clear. Let me think again.

In the case of matrix multiplication, the key is to compute the dot product between the i-th row of A and the j-th column of B. So for each element C[i][j], the thread needs to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. 

In Triton, each thread can be responsible for a single element of C. So the kernel would iterate over all i and j, and for each, compute the sum. However, this is not efficient because each thread would have to access K elements. To optimize, we can use a block size that allows for multiple elements to be computed in parallel. But that might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, we can use a more optimized approach where each thread block handles a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B, and each thread in the block computes a single element of C. For example, if the block size is 32, then each block handles 32 rows of A and 32 columns of B. Each thread in the block would compute one element of C. However, this requires that the block size is chosen such that the number of threads per block is block_rows * block_cols. But this is

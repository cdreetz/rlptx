Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that matrix multiplication involves computing each element of the resulting matrix as the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix. But with large matrices, doing this naively would be too slow. So, using shared memory and tiling is the way to go.

The input tensors are A (M x K) and B (K x N). The output tensor C will be M x N. Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

In Triton, I need to structure the kernel to handle this efficiently. The key is to use shared memory for A and B to reduce global memory access latency. So, I'll need to split the matrices into tiles that fit into shared memory.

Let me think about the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 is common. Let's say I choose a block size of 32. Each thread in the block will handle a portion of the computation.

Each thread will compute a block of the output matrix. For example, if the block size is 32, each thread might compute a single element of C. Wait, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, each thread could compute a block of elements. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of how many elements each thread processes.

Wait, in the standard approach for matrix multiplication with shared memory, each thread block processes a tile of A and B. For example, if the tile size is 32x32, then each thread block handles a 32x32 tile of A and B. But since A is M x K and B is K x N, the tile size needs to fit into the shared memory.

But perhaps I should think in terms of how many elements each thread computes. Let me recall that in the standard approach, each thread block handles a tile of A (size TILE_M x TILE_K) and a tile of B (size TILE_K x TILE_N). Then, each thread in the block computes a single element of the output matrix C. But that might not be efficient for large matrices. Alternatively, maybe each thread computes a block of elements.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread computes a single element of C. But that's not efficient. Wait, perhaps the kernel is designed so that each thread block handles a block of the output matrix. For example, each thread block computes a block of C, which is a TILE_M x TILE_N block. But how does that work with the A and B matrices?

Alternatively, the standard approach is to have each thread block compute a tile of A and B, and then compute the dot product between them. For example, each thread block handles a tile of A (size TILE_M x TILE_K) and a tile of B (size TILE_K x TILE_N). Then, each thread in the block computes a single element of the output matrix. But that would require that the tile size is such that the product of TILE_M and TILE_K is manageable in shared memory.

But I need to think about the exact structure. Let's assume that the block size is 32. Let me think of the kernel as follows:

Each thread in the block is responsible for computing a single element of C. However, to do this efficiently, each thread would load a row from A and a column from B, then compute the dot product. But that's not efficient because it would require loading all elements of a row and column, which could be expensive.

Wait, the standard approach for matrix multiplication with shared memory is to use a tile-based approach where each thread block loads a tile of A and a tile of B into shared memory, then computes the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B. But for that, the tile size must be such that the number of elements in the tile is manageable in shared memory.

So, for example, if the tile size is 32x32, then each thread block would load a 32x32 tile of A and a 32x32 tile of B into shared memory. Then, each thread in the block would compute a single element of the output matrix. However, this would require that the number of threads in the block is sufficient to compute all the elements of the output matrix.

But how does that work? Let me think again. The output matrix C is M x N. So, if the tile size is TILE_M x TILE_N, then each thread block handles a TILE_M x TILE_N block of C. But the tile size for A and B would be TILE_K x TILE_K, since A is M x K and B is

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in Triton.

First, the input tensors are A (MxK) and B (KxN). The result is a matrix C (MxN) where each element C[i,j] is the sum of A[i,k] * B[k,j] for all k. But doing this naively would be too slow, so we need to use shared memory and tile-based computation.

In Triton, the kernel is written in a way that each thread handles a small block of elements. For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to divide the matrices into tiles. Each tile is stored in shared memory to reduce memory access latency.

Let me think about the steps:

1. **Memory Layout**: The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. For shared memory, we'll need to load tiles of A and B into shared memory. The tile size is usually chosen based on the block size. Let's say each thread block processes a tile of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). So, for A (MxK), each tile is of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), and similarly for B (KxN).

Wait, but the dimensions might not align perfectly. So the kernel will have to handle cases where the dimensions aren't multiples of the block size. That's where masking comes in.

2. **Shared Memory**: Each thread block will have its own shared memory. For A, each thread will load a tile of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) into shared memory. Similarly for B. Then, each thread computes a part of the result matrix C.

3. **Thread Block Structure**: The kernel will have multiple thread blocks. Each thread block is responsible for computing a portion of the result matrix. The threads within a block will compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B.

4. **Block Size**: The block size is usually a power of two. Let's choose BLOCK_SIZE = 128. That's a common choice for Triton kernels. So each thread block will process a tile of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) for A and B.

But wait, for matrix multiplication, the tiles for A and B need to be compatible. For example, if A is MxK, then each tile of A is (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), and the number of tiles along K would be ceil(K / BLOCK_SIZE). Similarly for B, which is KxN, each tile is (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), and the number of tiles along N would be ceil(N / BLOCK_SIZE).

But in the kernel, each thread block will process a specific tile of A and B. So the kernel needs to handle the indices for the tiles and the elements within the tiles.

5. **Memory Access Patterns**: For each thread, the index in the tile is (i, j). The thread will compute the dot product between the row i of A's tile and the column j of B's tile. So for each thread, the computation is sum over k (A[i][k] * B[k][j]).

But in the shared memory, A's tile is stored as a 2D array, and B's tile is stored as a 2D array. So for each thread, the index in the tile is (i, j), and the k index is the column index in the tile. Wait, maybe I need to think about how the tiles are stored.

Let me structure the kernel:

- The kernel is launched with grid dimensions that cover all the elements of the result matrix. Each thread block handles a specific tile of A and B, and computes the corresponding part of C.

But perhaps a better approach is to have each thread block handle a tile of A and a tile of B. The kernel will have to compute the dot product between the rows of A's tile and columns of B's tile. So for each thread, the index in the tile is (i, j), and the thread computes the element C[i + offset_row][j + offset_col] as the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for k in the tile's range.

But how to map the thread indices to the tile indices? Let me think.

Each thread in the block is responsible for a specific element in the tile. For example, in the block, the threads are divided into rows and columns. So, for a block of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), each thread has a row index i and column index j within the block. Then, the thread computes the dot product between the row i of A's tile and the column j of B's tile.

Wait, but in matrix multiplication, the dot product is between the row of A and the column of B. So for

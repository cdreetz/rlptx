Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the minimum value along each row (since the last dimension is N, and we're reducing along it). So for each row in the tensor, I need to find the minimum value. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Next, input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor with dimensions [M, N], and the output is a 1D tensor with [M] elements. The memory layout is important here. Since we're processing rows, each row is a separate column in the input tensor. So each thread should handle one row, and process all elements in that row.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels typically use a block size that's a power of two. Let's say BLOCK_SIZE = 256. Each thread block will handle a certain number of rows. But since we're reducing along the last dimension, each thread block needs to process all elements in a row. Wait, no. Wait, for each row, we need to find the minimum. So each thread block can process a single row. But if the number of rows (M) is large, we need to have multiple thread blocks. Alternatively, maybe each thread block processes multiple rows, but that might complicate the reduction. Alternatively, since each row is independent, maybe each thread block can handle a single row, and each thread in the block processes a single element in that row. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, for each row, we can have a thread block that reduces the row. But how to structure that.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to have each thread block process a single row. For each row, the threads in the block will compute the minimum. But how to do that. Let's think: For a row, we have N elements. The number of threads in a block should be sufficient to process all elements in the row. But if the row has N elements, and the block size is 256, then for N up to 256, each block can process a row. But if N is larger than 256, then we need to have multiple threads per row. But that's not possible if the block size is fixed. So maybe the approach is to have each thread process a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction within the block.

Wait, but for each row, the minimum is computed by reducing all elements in that row. So for each row, we need to perform a reduction across all N elements. So for each row, the threads in the block will process elements in that row, and then perform a reduction. So the kernel will have to process each row, and for each row, the threads in the block will compute the minimum.

So the steps would be:

1. For each row in the input tensor (i.e., each row index i from 0 to M-1), process all elements in that row (columns 0 to N-1).

2. For each row, the threads in the block will compute the minimum of the elements in that row.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let me think about the kernel parameters. The kernel needs to know the shape of the input tensor (M, N), and the output tensor (M). The kernel will process each row, and for each row, compute the minimum.

So, the kernel will have to iterate over each row, and for each row, process all elements in that row. But how to do that with Triton's loop structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread block processes a single row. Then, within the block, the threads work together to compute the minimum of that row.

But how to assign the rows to the blocks. Let's think: the number of blocks is ceil(M / num_blocks_per_row). But maybe each block handles a single row. So the kernel's outer loop is over the rows. For each row, the block processes that row.

But how to do that in Triton. Let me recall that in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows. For example, the kernel might have a loop that iterates over the row index i, and for each i, process the elements in that row.

But how to handle that in the kernel. Let me think about the code structure.

First, the kernel will have to take the input tensor, output tensor, M, N as parameters. Then, for each row i, we need to compute the minimum of the elements in that row.

So the kernel would look something like:

@triton.jit
def kernel(...):
    i = ...  #

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the minimum value along each row (since the last dimension is N, and we're reducing over it). So for each row in the tensor, I need to find the minimum value. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Next, input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor with dimensions [M, N], and the output is [M]. The memory layout is important here. Since we're processing rows, each thread should handle one row. But how to organize the threads?

For the kernel, I'll need to process each row. Let's consider how many threads per block. Let's say we have BLOCK_SIZE = 256. Each thread can handle a single row. But wait, if the number of rows (M) is not a multiple of the block size, we need to handle that. But Triton handles that automatically with the grid and block counts.

Wait, actually, in Triton, the kernel is launched with a grid that covers all the rows. Each thread in the block processes one row. So for each row i, the thread will process all elements in that row (columns 0 to N-1) and find the minimum.

But how to structure the threads. Let me think: the kernel will have a grid of size M, and each thread in the block will handle one row. But if M is larger than the number of threads per block, then multiple blocks are needed. So the kernel should be designed such that each thread processes one row.

But wait, maybe I should think in terms of threads per block. Let me decide on a block size. Let's say BLOCK_SIZE = 256. Each thread will handle one row. But if the number of rows is not a multiple of 256, then some threads in the last block will be idle. That's okay, as Triton handles that.

So the kernel will have a grid of size M, and each thread in the block will process one row. But how to compute the row index for each thread? The thread index in the block (tid) will correspond to the row index. So for each thread, the row is tid.

But wait, in Triton, the kernel is launched with a grid of size (M, 1), and each block has a number of threads equal to the block size. So the thread index in the block (tid) is the row index. So for each row i, the thread will process that row.

Now, for each row, the thread needs to find the minimum value. How to do that? Well, for each row, the thread can iterate over all the elements in that row and find the minimum. But that would be O(N) per row, which is acceptable if N is not too big. However, for large N, this might be inefficient. But since the problem is to compute the minimum along the last dimension, this is the correct approach.

But how to implement this in Triton. Let's outline the steps:

1. For each row i (from 0 to M-1):
   a. Load the elements of row i from the input tensor.
   b. Find the minimum value in that row.
   c. Store the minimum value in the output tensor at position i.

So, in the kernel, each thread will handle one row. The input tensor is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. The output is a 1D tensor of shape [M].

Now, for memory access. The input tensor is accessed as input[i][j], where i is the row and j is the column. The output is output[i].

But in Triton, the kernel needs to access the input and output tensors. The input tensor is passed as a pointer, and the output is another pointer. The kernel will need to compute the offsets for the input tensor.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensor is stored as a contiguous array in memory. For a 2D tensor, the memory layout is row-major. So for row i and column j, the offset is i * N + j. But in Triton, the kernel needs to calculate the offset based on the row and column indices.

So, for each row i, the thread will iterate over all columns j from 0 to N-1. But how to do that efficiently? Well, for each row, the thread can compute the minimum by checking each element in the row. However, if N is large, this could be slow. But given that the problem is to compute the minimum, this is the correct approach.

But in Triton, the kernel is written in a way

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the maximum element). So for each row, we need to compute the max of N elements. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the max of the corresponding row.

Now, considering how Triton works, I need to structure the kernel to process these rows efficiently. Let's think about the input and output tensors. The input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N], and the output is a 1D tensor of shape [M].

In Triton, each kernel is launched with a grid of warps and blocks. For this problem, I need to process each row independently. So, each block can handle one row. But wait, maybe I should think in terms of blocks processing multiple elements? Or maybe each block handles one row. Let me think about the block size.

If each block processes one row, then the number of blocks would be M. But with Triton, the number of blocks is determined by the grid size. Alternatively, maybe we can have each block process a portion of the rows. However, since each row is independent, it's better to have each block handle one row. But how to structure that.

Wait, the kernel is written in a way that each thread processes a certain element. But for a max reduction, each thread would need to compare elements in the row. So, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a particular element in the row, and then we perform a reduction across the threads in the block.

Alternatively, maybe each block processes a row, and within the block, the threads perform a reduction to find the max of that row.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensor is [M, N], so each row is of length N. For each row, we need to find the maximum. So, for a given row i, we need to process elements from column 0 to N-1.

In Triton, the threads can be arranged in a way that each thread handles a particular element in the row. But for a reduction, we need to have a way to compare all elements in the row and find the maximum. So, perhaps each thread in the block is responsible for a certain element, and then they perform a reduction across the threads.

But how to structure the threads. Let's think of the block size. Let's say each block handles one row. Then, for each row, we have N elements. The block size can be set to N, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, we can have a block size that is a power of two, and each thread in the block processes a certain element, then reduces across the threads.

Alternatively, maybe the block size is set to a value that allows for efficient reduction. For example, using a block size of 1024, but that might not be optimal for N. Wait, but for each row, the number of elements is N. So, the block size should be chosen such that each block can process a row's elements.

Alternatively, perhaps each block is responsible for a single row. Then, the threads in the block can work together to find the maximum of that row. For example, if the block has 1024 threads, but the row has N elements, then each thread would process a certain element, and then the threads would perform a reduction to find the maximum.

But how to handle this. Let's think of the kernel as follows: For each row i, the block processes that row. The threads in the block are responsible for different elements in the row. Then, the threads perform a reduction to find the max.

But how to map the threads to the elements in the row. Let's say that for a given row, the elements are in the input tensor. So, for row i, the elements are at positions (i, 0), (i, 1), ..., (i, N-1).

So, for each row i, we need to process all N elements. The block size can be set to a value that allows for efficient reduction. Let's say that the block size is 1024, but that's arbitrary. Wait, perhaps the block size should be chosen such that the number of threads per block is a power of two, allowing for efficient reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the block size is set to 1024, and for each row, the threads process the elements in a way that they can reduce to find the maximum.

But how to handle the row index. Let me think about the kernel parameters. The kernel will be launched with grid size M, and each

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the maximum element). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the max of N elements.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the max of the corresponding row.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Since we're processing each row, I should consider how to partition the rows into blocks. Let's say each block handles a certain number of rows. But since each row has N elements, and we need to process all N elements per row, the block size should be chosen to efficiently process these elements. For example, if each thread handles a single element in a row, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, using a block size that can process multiple elements per thread, but that depends on the data layout.

Wait, in Triton, threads are grouped into blocks. Each block can have multiple threads. For each row, we need to process all N elements. So perhaps each block is responsible for a single row. But if N is large, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in a row, and the block processes multiple elements. Hmm, but for max reduction, each thread would need to compare with others. Maybe a better approach is to have each thread process a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction within the block.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, the max can be computed by having each thread compare its element with others. So for each row, we can have a reduction over the N elements. But how to structure this in Triton.

Let me think of the kernel structure. Let's say we have M rows. Each row has N elements. For each row, we need to compute the max of N elements. So, the kernel should process each row, and for each row, compute the max.

So, the kernel will have a loop over the rows. For each row, we process all N elements. But how to structure this in Triton.

In Triton, each thread is assigned a unique index. So perhaps we can have each thread handle a specific element in a specific row. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, we can have each block handle a single row, and within the block, perform the reduction over the elements of that row.

Wait, but for a row with N elements, the number of threads per block would need to be at least N. But if N is large, that might not be feasible. Alternatively, we can have each thread handle a single element, and then perform a reduction across the threads in the block.

But for that, the block size needs to be chosen such that it can handle the reduction. For example, if the block size is 1024, then each block can process up to 1024 elements. But if N is larger than that, then multiple blocks would be needed. However, in this case, each row is processed by a block, and the block's threads handle the elements of that row.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that for each row, we have a group of threads that process that row. For example, each block is responsible for a single row, and within the block, the threads process the elements of that row. But that might not be efficient if the row has many elements.

Alternatively, think of it as for each row, we need to compute the max of N elements. So for each row, we can have a reduction over the N elements. So, the kernel would have a loop over the rows, and for each row, perform a reduction over the N elements.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let's think about the kernel parameters. The input tensor is of shape [M, N], and the output is [M].

Each thread is responsible for a single element in a row. But for the reduction, we need to compare all elements in the row. So, perhaps the kernel is structured as follows:

- The kernel is launched with M rows, and each row is processed by a block. Each block has a certain number of threads, and each thread is responsible for a specific element in the row. Then, within the block, the threads perform a reduction to find the max.

But how to assign the threads to the elements. For example, if the block has 1024 threads, and a row has N elements, then each thread would process one element. But if N is larger than the block size, then multiple blocks

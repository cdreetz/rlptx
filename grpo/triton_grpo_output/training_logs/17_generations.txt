Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to compute the mean of each row. So for each row (each M element), I need to sum all the elements in that row and then divide by N. Since it's a mean along the last dimension, each row is processed independently.

Next, the input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

Now, considering the Triton kernel structure. Triton kernels are written with a grid and a block. The kernel needs to process each row. So, each thread should handle one row. But wait, how to split the rows among threads? Maybe each thread handles a single row. But if there are multiple threads, they can process different rows. But since the rows are independent, this should be straightforward.

But wait, the kernel is for a 2D tensor. So, each thread will process a row. Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. So, for a given row i, the elements are at positions i*N, i*N+1, ..., i*N + N-1.

So, for each thread, I need to sum the elements in row i. Then, divide by N to get the mean.

But how to handle the threads? The number of threads per block can be determined. Let's say we have a block size of, say, 1024. But since each thread processes a row, the number of threads per block would be the number of rows per block. Wait, but if the number of rows (M) is not divisible by the block size, then we need to handle that. However, in Triton, the kernel is launched with a grid that is determined by the number of rows. So, each thread in the block will handle one row.

Wait, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread processes a single row. So, the number of threads in the block is equal to the number of rows. But that might not be efficient if M is large. Alternatively, maybe we can process multiple rows per thread, but that's not possible here because each row is independent. So, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single row.

But how to structure the kernel. Let me think: the kernel will have a loop over the rows. Each thread is assigned a row index. Then, for that row, sum all elements.

So, the kernel would have a loop over the rows, and for each row, sum the elements. Then, divide by N.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a grid and a block. So, the grid is determined by the number of rows. Each thread in the block handles one row.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is launched with a grid of size (num_rows, 1), and each thread in the block is responsible for a row. So, the kernel would look like:

@triton.jit
def kernel(...):
    row_id = tl.program_id(0)
    # process row_id

But then, for each row, we need to sum all N elements. So, for each row, we can load the elements from the input tensor, sum them, then divide by N.

But how to handle the memory access. Let's say the input tensor is a 2D tensor, stored as a 1D array. So, for row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j, where j ranges from 0 to N-1.

So, for each row, we can load all the elements in that row. But if N is large, loading all elements for each row could be expensive. However, since each row is contiguous in memory, we can use a loop to load each element.

But in Triton, for each thread, we can process a row. So, for each row, we need to sum all N elements. So, for each row, the thread would:

1. Load the elements of the row into a register.
2. Sum them.
3. Divide by N to get the mean.
4. Store the result in the output tensor.

But how to handle the sum. Let's think about the memory access. For each row, the elements are in contiguous memory. So, for a given row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j for j in 0..N-1.

But in Triton, the threads can process the elements in a way that minimizes memory latency. For example, if N is large, we can load the elements in chunks. But perhaps for simplicity, we can process each

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to compute the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. Since it's a 2D tensor, each row is of length N. So for each row (i.e., each row index M), I need to sum all elements in that row and then divide by N.

So the steps are: for each row, sum the elements, then divide by N. The output will be a 1D tensor of shape [M].

Now, input and output tensor shapes. The input is [M, N], and the output is [M]. The input is a 2D tensor, and the output is a 1D tensor. The memory layout is probably row-major, which is the default for tensors in Triton.

Next, optimal block sizes and memory access patterns. Since each row is processed independently, I can have each thread handle a single row. But how many threads per block? Let's think about the number of rows, M. If M is large, we need to have enough threads per block. Typically, a block size of 256 is common. But since each thread processes a row, the number of threads per block would be the number of rows that fit into the block. Wait, but if M is the number of rows, then each thread can handle one row. So the block size would be determined by the number of rows. However, if M is not a multiple of the block size, we need to handle that. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread process a single element in a row, but that might not be efficient. Wait, no. For each row, we need to sum all N elements. So each thread could be responsible for a single element in the row, but that would require N threads per row, which might not be efficient. Alternatively, we can have each thread handle a single row, and then sum the elements in that row. But how?

Wait, maybe the threads are arranged such that each thread handles a single row. So for each row, the thread would load all N elements, sum them, and then divide by N. But that would require each thread to process N elements, which could be expensive. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread process a subset of the elements in the row. For example, if the block size is 256, then each thread can process a chunk of elements in the row. But that would require more complex logic.

Alternatively, since each row has N elements, and we need to sum them, perhaps the best way is to have each thread handle a single element in the row. But that would mean that for each row, there are N threads processing each element. However, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread process a single row, and then sum all elements in that row. But how to sum them?

Wait, perhaps the approach is to have each thread process a single row. For each row, the thread would load all N elements, sum them, and then divide by N. But how to load the elements? For example, if the row is at index i, then the elements are at positions (i, 0), (i, 1), ..., (i, N-1). So for each row, the thread would need to load all N elements. But that would require N memory accesses per thread, which might be slow. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread handle a block of elements in the row. For example, if the block size is 256, and each thread processes a chunk of elements. But that would require more complex logic.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a reduction approach. For each row, we can compute the sum by having multiple threads contribute to the sum. For example, each thread could process a subset of the elements in the row and then reduce the sum. But that would require more complex logic.

Wait, perhaps the optimal way is to have each thread handle a single row. Then, for each row, the thread would iterate over all elements in the row, sum them, and then divide by N. However, this would require that each thread has to process N elements. For example, if N is 1024, then each thread would need to process 1024 elements. But that's a lot of memory accesses. However, if the row is stored in contiguous memory, then we can use a loop over the elements in the row.

But how to structure the kernel. Let me think about the kernel's parameters. The input tensor is of shape [M, N], and the output is [M]. So, the kernel would need to process each row. Let's assume that the input is a 2D tensor, and the output

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. Matrix multiplication involves computing each element of the resulting matrix as the dot product of the corresponding row from the first matrix and column from the second. So for each element (i, j) in the output matrix, it's the sum over k from 0 to K-1 of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

Now, the input tensors: the first is MxK, the second is KxN. The output will be MxN. So the kernel needs to handle these shapes.

Memory layout: The input tensors are likely stored in row-major order. So for the first matrix A, each row is contiguous in memory. Similarly for B. The output matrix C will be stored in row-major as well.

Optimal block sizes. Triton kernels typically use a block size that's a multiple of 32, maybe 128 or 256. But for matrix multiplication, the block size is often chosen based on the problem size. Let's say we use a block size of 128, which is a common choice. But I need to make sure that the threads per block can handle the K dimension efficiently.

Memory access patterns: For each thread, we need to compute a dot product. So each thread will handle a specific element in the output matrix. But how to partition the work? Maybe each thread block handles a row of A and a column of B. Wait, but in matrix multiplication, each thread block can handle a portion of the matrix. Alternatively, using a standard approach where each thread block computes a block of the output matrix.

Wait, in the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton, each thread block handles a block of the output matrix. For example, each thread block computes a submatrix of C. But given that the input matrices are MxK and KxN, perhaps the block size is chosen such that each thread block can compute a certain number of elements in the output.

Alternatively, for each thread, we can compute a single element of the output. But that might not be efficient. So perhaps using a more efficient approach where each thread block handles a block of the output.

But maybe I should think in terms of the standard matrix multiplication approach. Let me recall that in Triton, for matrix multiplication, each thread block is responsible for computing a block of the output matrix. The threads within the block are responsible for computing the elements of that block.

But perhaps for this problem, since the input matrices are of size MxK and KxN, the kernel can be structured such that each thread block handles a row of A and a column of B. Wait, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, each thread block can handle a certain number of rows in A and columns in B, but that depends on the block size.

Alternatively, the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to have each thread block compute a block of the output matrix. For example, each thread block is responsible for computing a submatrix of C. The threads within the block compute the elements of that submatrix. The block size is chosen such that the number of threads per block can handle the K dimension.

Let me think about the block size. Suppose we have a block size of 128. Then, each thread block can handle a certain number of rows in A and columns in B. For example, if the block size is 128, then each thread block can compute a block of C with dimensions (block_rows, block_cols), where block_rows is the number of rows in A that the block handles, and block_cols is the number of columns in B that the block handles. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread computes a single element of the output matrix. But that would be inefficient because each element requires a dot product over K elements. However, with proper memory access patterns, it might be possible.

Wait, but for matrix multiplication, the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element of the output matrix. So for each element C[i][j], the thread computes the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. But this would require that each thread has access to the corresponding elements of A and B.

But in that case, the threads would need to compute the dot product for each element. However, this approach may not be efficient for large K, since each thread would need to perform K operations. So perhaps a better approach is to use a block size that allows for more efficient computation, like using a block size that can handle multiple elements in the dot product.

Alternatively, using a block size that allows for each thread to compute a certain number of elements in the dot product. For example, if K is large, each thread

Okay, let's tackle this Triton kernel for matrix multiplication. The user wants to multiply two matrices: one of shape [M, K] and another of shape [K, N]. The result should be a matrix of shape [M, N]. 

First, I need to recall how matrix multiplication works. Each element in the resulting matrix is the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix. So for each element (i, j) in the output, it's the sum over k from 0 to K-1 of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

Now, considering Triton's capabilities. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA, but with more flexibility. The key is to structure the kernel to efficiently use the GPU's parallelism.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors are stored in row-major order, which is the default for most GPU frameworks. So for the first matrix A (M, K), each row is contiguous in memory. Similarly, matrix B (K, N) has each row contiguous. 

The output matrix C (M, N) will need to be computed. Each element in C is the sum of products of elements from A's rows and B's columns. 

Next, I need to decide on the block size. Triton kernels typically use a block size that's a power of two for efficiency. Let's say BLOCK_SIZE = 256. But how to split the problem into threads? Each thread can handle a specific element in the output matrix. However, since each element requires K operations (the sum over k), we need to ensure that each thread can compute the sum efficiently.

Wait, but if each thread computes one element of C, then for each element, the thread would need to iterate over K elements. However, if K is large, this could be slow. So maybe we need to optimize by having each thread compute multiple elements or use a more efficient approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using a more efficient approach where each thread block handles a block of rows and columns. For example, each thread block could compute a block of C's elements. But that might complicate things. Let's think again.

Another approach is to use a tiled approach where each thread block handles a tile of the matrices. But given that the problem is general, maybe it's better to use a simpler approach where each thread computes one element of C. However, that might not be efficient for large K.

Alternatively, maybe we can split the computation into multiple threads per element. For example, if K is large, we can have multiple threads contributing to the same element. But that might complicate the masking.

Wait, the user's problem is to multiply two matrices. The standard approach for Triton is to have each thread compute a single element of the output. So for each element C[i][j], the thread would compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. 

But for that, each thread would need to access K elements from A and B. However, if K is large, this could be slow. So perhaps we need to optimize the number of operations per thread. 

Alternatively, maybe we can use a more efficient approach where each thread block handles a block of rows and columns. For example, each thread block could handle a block of size (block_rows, block_cols) in the output matrix. But that's more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps using a more efficient approach where each thread block computes multiple elements. But for simplicity, let's start with the basic approach where each thread computes one element.

So, for the kernel, each thread will be responsible for computing one element of C. The thread index can be determined by the thread's position in the block. 

Let me think about the indices. For a given thread, the i (row) and j (column) in the output matrix can be determined by the thread's position. For example, if the block is divided into threads, each thread could be responsible for a specific (i, j) pair. However, this would require that the threads are arranged in a way that each thread can compute one (i, j) pair.

But how to map the thread index to (i, j)? Let's assume that the block is divided into threads in a way that each thread is responsible for a specific (i, j) pair. However, this would require that the block size is such that the number of threads per block can handle all possible (i, j) pairs. But that's not feasible for large M and N.

Alternatively, perhaps using a more efficient approach where each thread block handles a block of rows and columns. For example, each thread block computes a block of size (block_rows, block_cols) in the output matrix. Then, each thread in the block would compute a specific element in that block. But this is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps using a more

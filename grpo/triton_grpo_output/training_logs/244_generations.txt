Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The user mentioned using tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that matrix multiplication involves computing each element of the resulting matrix as the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix. Since we're using shared memory, I should probably split the matrices into tiles that fit into the shared memory. The key is to minimize global memory access by loading data into shared memory and then performing the computation there.

Let me recall the steps for a Triton kernel. The kernel will have a loop over the rows of the first matrix (M) and columns of the second matrix (N). For each element in the result, I need to compute the sum of the products of corresponding elements from the row and column.

But wait, the matrices are [M, K] and [K, N]. So the first matrix is A (M rows, K columns), the second is B (K rows, N columns). The result C will be [M, N]. Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

In Triton, I need to handle the indices properly. Let's think about the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 is used. Let's choose 32 as a common block size. But I need to make sure that the threads in the block can handle the computation efficiently.

Now, for shared memory. Each thread block will load a tile of A and B into shared memory. The tile size should be such that it fits into the shared memory. Let's assume that the tile size is 32x32. But wait, the actual tile size depends on the block size. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread might handle a part of the tile.

Wait, maybe I should structure the kernel such that each thread block handles a portion of the matrix. For example, each block processes a block of rows from A and columns from B. But I need to make sure that the tiles are properly aligned.

Alternatively, the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to have each thread compute a single element of the result. But that might not be efficient. Instead, using tile-based computation, each thread block handles a tile of A and B, and computes the result in shared memory.

Let me think about the shared memory layout. For A, each thread block will load a tile of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) into shared memory. Similarly for B. Then, each thread in the block computes the dot product of a row from A and a column from B.

Wait, but the dimensions of A and B are M x K and K x N. So for the tile-based approach, the block size should be such that the tiles fit into the shared memory. Let me think about the block size. Let's say the block size is 32. Then, each thread block will process a tile of A of size (32, 32) and B of size (32, 32). But K must be at least 32 for this to work. However, if K is smaller than 32, then the tile size would be adjusted. But perhaps the kernel should handle that by using a dynamic block size.

Alternatively, the kernel should be written in a way that the tile size is a parameter. But in Triton, the block size is fixed. So maybe the tile size is determined by the block size. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread in the block handles a part of the tile.

Wait, maybe I should structure the kernel such that each thread block handles a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. For example, each block computes a submatrix of the result. But I need to make sure that the tiles of A and B are loaded into shared memory.

Let me outline the steps:

1. The kernel is launched with grid dimensions that cover all rows of A (M) and columns of B (N). Each thread block handles a certain number of rows and columns.

2. For each thread block, the threads load a tile of A and B into shared memory. The tile size is determined by the block size. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread block processes a tile of size (32, 32) for A and (32, 32) for B. However, this may not fit if K or N is smaller than 32. But the kernel should handle that with masking.

3. Each thread in the block computes a part of the dot product. For example, each thread computes the product of A[i][k] and B[k

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through the steps.

First, the GPU operations. Matrix multiplication involves computing each element of the resulting matrix as the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second. Since we're using shared memory, I'll need to break down the matrices into tiles that fit into shared memory. The key is to compute these tiles efficiently.

Input tensors: Let's say the first matrix is A with shape [M, K], and the second is B with shape [K, N]. The output matrix C will be [M, N]. Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

For tile-based computation, I'll divide the matrices into blocks. Let's assume each tile is of size TILE_M x TILE_K for matrix A, and TILE_K x TILE_N for matrix B. But since the matrices are [M, K] and [K, N], maybe the tiles should be arranged so that each tile of A is (TILE_M, TILE_K) and each tile of B is (TILE_K, TILE_N). Wait, but the actual tile size depends on the shared memory capacity. Let me recall that shared memory is limited, so the tiles need to be small enough to fit into it.

In Triton, the kernel will have multiple threads per block. Each thread might handle a part of the computation. But for matrix multiplication, a common approach is to have each thread compute a single element of the result. However, with shared memory, we can load tiles into shared memory and compute the dot product in parallel.

Wait, but for tile-based computation, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread block handles a tile of the result matrix. Alternatively, perhaps each thread is responsible for a small block of the result. But I need to think about the memory layout and how to access the shared memory.

Let me think about the standard approach for matrix multiplication with shared memory. The idea is to split the matrices into tiles. For example, if the matrices are large, we can split them into blocks of size TILE_M x TILE_K for A and TILE_K x TILE_N for B. Then, each thread block handles a tile of the result matrix. However, since the problem states to use tile-based computation with shared memory, perhaps the kernel is structured to process tiles of the input matrices and compute the corresponding part of the output.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed so that each thread computes a single element of the output matrix, but uses shared memory to store the relevant rows and columns of the input matrices. But that might not be efficient for large K. So, perhaps the standard approach is to use shared memory to store tiles of the input matrices, and compute the dot product between the tiles.

Let me outline the steps:

1. For each block of threads, compute a tile of the output matrix C. The tile size would be determined by the shared memory available.

2. The first matrix A is divided into tiles of size (TILE_M, TILE_K), and the second matrix B is divided into tiles of size (TILE_K, TILE_N). The output matrix C is divided into tiles of size (TILE_M, TILE_N).

3. Each thread block handles a tile of the output matrix. However, in Triton, the kernel is typically structured with multiple threads per block, each handling a part of the computation.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for computing a single element of the result. But with shared memory, we can load the relevant rows of A and columns of B into shared memory, then compute the dot product.

Wait, but that would require each thread to compute a single element, which is the standard approach. Let me think about the memory layout.

Assuming that the input matrices A and B are stored in global memory. For each element C[i][j], we need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. To do this efficiently, we can load the row i of A into shared memory, and the column j of B into shared memory, then compute the dot product. But this would require each thread to handle a single element, which could be inefficient for large K.

Alternatively, using a tile-based approach where each thread block handles a block of rows and columns. For example, each thread block handles a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B, and computes the corresponding part of the output matrix.

But I need to think about the exact structure. Let's consider that each thread block is responsible for computing a tile of the output matrix. The tile size for the output matrix would be TILE_M x TILE_N. However, the input matrices A and B have dimensions M x K and K x N

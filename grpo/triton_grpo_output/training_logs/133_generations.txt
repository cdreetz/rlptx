Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the maximum element). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the max of N elements.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the maximum of the corresponding row.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Since we're dealing with rows, each block can process a row. But since each row has N elements, and N can be large, we need to figure out how to process each row efficiently. Let's think about how to structure the threads. Each thread can handle a single element in the row, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, we can have each thread process a chunk of elements, but since we need to find the max, perhaps each thread can be responsible for a part of the row and then compare with others.

Wait, but for max reduction, a common approach is to have each thread process a portion of the data and then compare with others. However, since the reduction is along the last dimension, each row is independent. So maybe each block can handle one row, and within the block, the threads perform the reduction.

But how to structure that. Let's think about the block size. Let's say each block processes one row. Then, the number of blocks would be M. Each block would have multiple threads, and each thread would process a part of the row. But since the row is of size N, we need to divide N into chunks that each thread can process. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block can process N elements, but that depends on N's size.

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then the threads in the block compare their values to find the maximum. But that would require that each thread has a value, and then they compare pairwise. However, for large N, this could be inefficient. But since the problem is to compute the max of a row, maybe using a parallel reduction within the block is the way to go.

So, the approach would be:

- Each block processes one row (i.e., each block is responsible for a single row in the 2D tensor).
- Within the block, the threads perform a reduction to find the maximum of that row.
- The output for each row is stored in the output tensor.

But how to map the threads to the elements in the row. Let's say each thread in the block is responsible for a certain element in the row. For example, if the row has N elements, and the block has K threads, then each thread can handle a portion of the row. But since the reduction is over the entire row, the threads need to compute the max of their portion and then combine with others.

Alternatively, perhaps the block can process the entire row. For example, if the row has N elements, and the block has K threads, then each thread can take a chunk of elements and compute the max of that chunk, then combine with others. But this is similar to a parallel reduction.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let me think about the steps.

First, the kernel will have to loop over each row. For each row, we need to compute the max of all elements in that row.

So, the kernel's outer loop is over the rows (M). For each row, we process the elements in that row (N elements).

But how to structure the threads. Let's think about the block size. Let's say each block handles one row. Then, the number of blocks is M. Each block has a certain number of threads. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block can process one row, but how?

Wait, maybe not. Because for a row of N elements, if the block has K threads, then each thread can handle a portion of the row. For example, if N is 1024, and the block has 128 threads, then each thread can process 8 elements. Then, the threads can compute the max of their 8 elements, and then the block's threads can perform a reduction to find the overall max.

But how to do that in Triton. Let's think about the kernel code.

First, the kernel will have to loop over each row. For each row, we need to process the elements in that row.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows, and then for each row, process the elements.

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the maximum element). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the max of N elements.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the maximum of the corresponding row.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels typically use a grid of blocks, each processing a portion of the data. Since we're dealing with rows, each block can handle a row. But since each row has N elements, the block size should be chosen to efficiently process these elements. However, since the max operation is per row, maybe each block can handle one row. But wait, if the block size is too small, it might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each block processes multiple elements in a row, but since the max is a reduction, perhaps each block can handle a row and compute the max.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, how do we process that? Let's think about the reduction. For a row, we can use a parallel reduction. So each block would process a row, and within the block, perform a reduction to find the max.

But how to structure the kernel. Let me think: the kernel will have a grid of blocks, each block processing a row. For each row, the block will process all N elements in that row, compute the max.

But for a row of N elements, the number of threads per block would be N. However, if N is large, this could be inefficient. Alternatively, we can use a block size that's a power of two, and use a reduction tree within the block. For example, if the block size is 1024, then for a row of N elements, the number of threads per block would be ceil(N / 1024), but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe the block size is chosen such that each block handles a row, and the threads within the block process the elements of the row in a reduction fashion.

Wait, but for each row, the max is computed. So each block can be responsible for one row. Let me think: the kernel will have a grid of blocks, each block handles one row. For each row, the block will process all N elements in that row, compute the max.

But how to structure that. Let me think about the parameters. The input tensor is [M, N]. The output is [M]. So for each row i (from 0 to M-1), we need to compute the max of the elements in row i.

So, in the kernel, each thread will be responsible for a particular row. But wait, that's not right. Because for a row, we need to process all N elements. So perhaps each block is responsible for a single row, and within the block, the threads perform a reduction to find the max of that row.

But how to structure that. Let me think about the kernel parameters. The kernel will take the input tensor, the output tensor, the dimensions M and N. Then, for each row i, the block processes that row.

But in Triton, the kernel is launched with a grid of blocks, and each block has a set of threads. So perhaps each block is responsible for a single row. Let's say that each block processes one row. Then, for each row, the block has multiple threads that process the elements in that row.

But how to compute the max. For example, for a row of N elements, the threads in the block can be arranged in a way that they perform a parallel reduction. For example, if the block has 1024 threads, then for a row of N elements, each thread can take care of a portion of the elements, and then perform a reduction.

But how to determine the number of threads per block. Let's say that the block size is 1024. For each row, the threads in the block will process the elements of the row. However, if the row has N elements, then the number of threads per block would be the number of elements in the row. But that might be too large for some cases. Alternatively, maybe the block size is chosen as a power of two, and the threads in the block perform a reduction on the row.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread processes a single element in the row, and then the threads perform a reduction to find the max. But that would require that the number of threads per block is equal to the number

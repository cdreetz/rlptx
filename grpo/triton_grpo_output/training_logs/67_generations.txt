Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through the steps.

First, I remember that matrix multiplication involves computing C = A * B, where A is MxK and B is KxN. The result C will be MxN. But since we're using shared memory, I need to break down the problem into tiles. Each tile will be a block of rows from A and columns from B, which can be stored in shared memory to avoid repeated memory accesses.

So, the key steps would be:

1. Determine the block sizes. For Triton, typical block sizes are like 128 or 256 elements per thread. But since we're dealing with matrix multiplication, maybe a square block size? Like 16x16? Wait, but the exact block size depends on the problem. Let me think. The block size for each thread should be such that each thread can handle a small tile of the matrix. For example, if each thread handles a 16x16 tile, then the block size would be 16 elements per row. But I need to make sure that the threads can process the tiles efficiently.

Wait, in matrix multiplication, each thread usually handles a single element of the result. But with shared memory, we can compute a block of elements at once. So, for example, each threadblock would process a block of rows from A and columns from B, and compute the dot product of those blocks.

But the exact block size depends on the problem. Let me recall the standard approach. For example, in the standard matrix multiplication, each threadblock processes a tile of size (block_size, block_size), and each thread computes a part of the dot product. So, for a 16x16 block, each thread would compute one element of the result.

But in this case, since the matrices are [M,K] and [K,N], the shared memory would store a block of K elements from A and N elements from B. Wait, no. Let me think again. For each threadblock, we can load a block of K elements from A (since A is MxK) and a block of N elements from B (since B is KxN). Then, each thread in the block would compute the dot product between a row of A and a column of B.

Wait, but how to structure this. Let me think of the standard approach. The standard approach for matrix multiplication with shared memory is to split the matrices into tiles. Each tile is of size (block_size, block_size). For example, if the block size is 16, then each tile is 16x16. Then, each threadblock processes a tile of A and a tile of B, and computes the product.

But in this case, the matrices are A (MxK) and B (KxN). So, the dimensions are different. Let me think about the indices. For each element C[i][j], it's the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, for each thread, we need to compute a part of this sum.

In the tile-based approach, each threadblock would handle a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. So, for example, if the block size is 16, then each threadblock would handle 16 rows of A and 16 columns of B. Then, each thread in the block would compute a part of the dot product between a row of A and a column of B.

But how to structure the shared memory. Let me think: for each threadblock, we can load a block of K elements from A into shared memory, and a block of N elements from B into shared memory. Then, each thread would compute the dot product between a row of A and a column of B.

Wait, but the problem is that the dimensions of A and B are different. Let me think again. Suppose the block size is 16. Then, each threadblock would process a block of 16 rows from A (so, 16 rows of K elements each) and 16 columns from B (so, 16 columns of K elements each). Then, each thread would compute the dot product between a row of A and a column of B.

But the shared memory would need to store the block of A (16 rows x K elements) and the block of B (K elements x 16 columns). Wait, no. For B, each column is K elements. So, if we have 16 columns, then B's block would be Kx16. So, the shared memory for B would be stored as Kx16. Then, each thread would take a row from A's block

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two matrices with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that matrix multiplication involves computing each element of the resulting matrix as the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix. But with large matrices, doing this directly would be inefficient. So, using tile-based computation with shared memory is the way to go. This approach helps reduce memory access latency by loading data into shared memory and reusing it.

So, the input tensors are A (M,K) and B (K,N). The output is C (M,N). Each element C[i,j] is the sum over k of A[i,k] * B[k,j].

Now, the key is to partition the matrices into tiles. Let's think about the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 is used. Let's choose 32 for this example. So, each thread block will handle a tile of size (32, 32) from A and B. But wait, the dimensions of A and B might not be multiples of the block size. So, I need to handle that with proper tiling.

Wait, the problem says to use tile-based computation. So, each thread block will process a tile of A and B. The shared memory will store these tiles. The threads within the block will compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B.

But how to structure the threads? Each thread in the block will compute one element of the result matrix. However, since the tiles are of size (block_size, block_size), each thread would handle a portion of the dot product.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of how many threads are in a block. Let's say each block has BLOCK_SIZE threads. For matrix multiplication, the number of threads per block should be such that each thread can compute a part of the dot product. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread can handle one element of the result matrix, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for computing a part of the dot product.

Wait, maybe the standard approach is to have each thread block process a tile of A and B. For example, if A is of size M x K, then each tile is of size (block_size, block_size), and the number of tiles along K would be ceil(K / block_size). Similarly for B. But since B is K x N, the tile size would be (block_size, block_size), but the rows of B are of size K, so each tile would be block_size rows of B.

But perhaps I need to think about how to split the matrices into tiles. For example, the first matrix A (M,K) is split into tiles of size (block_size, block_size), and the second matrix B (K,N) is split into tiles of size (block_size, block_size). Then, each thread block processes a tile of A and a tile of B, and computes the product of these tiles, which would be a (block_size, block_size) matrix. However, since the tiles are of size (block_size, block_size), the number of threads per block would need to be such that each thread can compute one element of the product.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me recall the standard Triton matrix multiplication approach. In Triton, each thread block handles a tile of A and B. The threads in the block are divided into rows and columns of the tile. For example, if the block size is 32, then each block has 32 rows and 32 columns of threads. Each thread computes a part of the dot product between a row of A and a column of B.

Wait, maybe the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element of the result matrix. But for that, the threads would have to compute the sum over k of A[i,k] * B[k,j]. However, this would require that each thread has access to the entire row of A and column of B, which might not be efficient. Instead, the tile-based approach uses shared memory to store the tiles, and each thread computes a part of the dot product.

Alternatively, maybe the approach is to split the matrices into tiles of size (block_size, block_size). For example, each thread block processes a tile of A (block_size rows, block_size columns) and a tile of B (block_size rows, block_size columns). Then, the threads in the block compute the product of these tiles. However, the resulting tile would be (block_size, block_size), and the threads would need to compute the dot product between each row of A's tile and each column of B's tile.

But how to

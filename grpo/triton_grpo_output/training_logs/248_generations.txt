Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the maximum value). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the max of N elements.

Next, input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the max of the corresponding row.

Memory layout: The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. The output tensor will be a 1D array where each element corresponds to a row's maximum.

Optimal block sizes and memory access patterns. Since we're processing each row independently, we can process each row in a separate thread block. The number of threads per block should be such that each thread handles a single element in the row. However, since we need to find the max, we can use a reduction pattern within each block. Wait, but if each row is processed by a block, and each block handles one row, then maybe we can process each row in a single block. But for a row of N elements, how many threads per block? Let's think: if each thread handles one element, then for a row of N elements, we need N threads per block. But if N is large, this might not be efficient. Alternatively, we can use a block size that allows for a reduction within the block. For example, using a block size of 1024, and for each row, the threads in the block work together to compute the max. But how to split the elements into groups for reduction?

Wait, the standard approach for max reduction in a row is to use a reduction pattern. So for each row, the threads in the block compute the max of their assigned elements, then combine the results. So the block size should be such that it can handle the reduction. For example, if the row has N elements, then the number of threads per block should be a power of two that is less than or equal to N. But since Triton allows for dynamic block sizes, perhaps we can set a block size that's a power of two, and then handle the remaining elements with masking.

But how to structure the kernel. Let me think: the kernel will process each row. For each row, the threads in the block will compute the max. So the kernel will have a loop over the rows (M), and for each row, process the elements in that row.

So the kernel will have a loop over the rows. For each row, the threads in the block will process the elements in that row. Let's say the block size is 1024. For each row, the threads are assigned to elements in that row. For example, if the row has N elements, then each thread is responsible for a certain element. Then, the threads perform a reduction to find the max.

But how to handle the case where N is not a multiple of the block size? Well, the reduction can be done in a way that the threads in the block handle the elements in the row, and the last few elements are handled by the last few threads.

So the steps for the kernel:

1. For each row in the input tensor (M rows), process the elements in that row.
2. For each row, the threads in the block will compute the max of the elements in that row.
3. The output for the row is stored in the output tensor.

Now, the kernel parameters: The kernel will take the input tensor, output tensor, M, N, and the stride of the input tensor. Since the input is 2D, the stride is the number of elements per row, which is N. So for each row i, the starting index is i * N.

So the kernel will have:

- input: a tensor of shape [M, N]
- output: a tensor of shape [M]
- M: number of rows
- N: number of columns

Now, the kernel code:

We'll use the triton library. The kernel will be written with the @triton.jit decorator. The kernel will have parameters for the input and output tensors, and the M and N.

The kernel will loop over the rows. For each row, the threads in the block will process the elements in that row.

But how to handle the threads per block? Let's decide on a block size. Let's say we use a block size of 1024. But since the number of elements per row (N) can vary, we need to handle that. So for each row, the threads in the block will be assigned to elements

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the max of the elements in that row). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the maximum of N elements.

Now, considering how Triton works, the kernel will process elements in blocks. Since we're dealing with a 2D tensor, I need to decide on the block size and how to iterate over the elements.

Let me think about the input and output. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the maximum of the corresponding row.

In Triton, each thread block will process a certain number of elements. Since we're reducing along the last dimension, each thread block should handle a row. But wait, maybe not. Wait, for each row, we need to find the maximum. So each row is of length N. So perhaps each thread block processes a row, and within that row, the threads work together to find the maximum.

But how to structure this. Let's think about the block size. Let's say we have a block size of, say, 128. Each thread in the block will process a certain number of elements in the row. But for a reduction, we need to have threads cooperate to find the maximum.

Alternatively, maybe each thread block handles a row, and within the block, the threads work together to compute the max of that row. But how to split the elements in the row among the threads.

For example, if the row has N elements, and the block size is 128, then each thread in the block will handle a portion of the row. But if N is larger than the block size, then we need to have multiple threads per element. Wait, no. Wait, the row is of length N. So for each row, we need to process all N elements. So perhaps the block size is chosen such that each thread processes a certain number of elements, and then the threads combine their results.

Alternatively, maybe the block size is set to 1, and each thread handles one element. But that would be inefficient. So better to have a block size that allows for efficient reduction.

Wait, the standard way to do a reduction in Triton is to have each thread process a portion of the data, and then combine the results. For example, for a reduction along a dimension, each thread block processes a segment of the data, and then the threads within the block reduce the data.

But in this case, since the reduction is along the last dimension (N), each row is processed independently. So perhaps each thread block is responsible for a single row, and within that row, the threads work together to find the maximum.

But how to split the row into chunks. Let's think: For a row of N elements, the number of threads in the block would be the number of elements that can be processed in parallel. For example, if the block size is 128, then each thread in the block would handle a chunk of elements. But how to handle the case where N is not a multiple of the block size.

Alternatively, perhaps the block size is set to 1, and each thread handles one element. But that would be very inefficient for large N. So better to have a block size that can handle multiple elements per thread.

Alternatively, maybe the block size is set to a value that allows for efficient reduction. For example, for a row of N elements, the number of threads in the block would be the number of elements that can be processed in parallel. But how to structure this.

Alternatively, think of each thread block as processing a row. Each thread in the block is responsible for a certain number of elements in the row. For example, if the row has N elements and the block size is 128, then each thread in the block would handle a chunk of elements. But how to split the row into chunks.

Wait, perhaps the block size is chosen as the number of elements per thread. For example, if the block size is 128, then each thread in the block would process a single element. But that's not efficient. Wait, no. Wait, in a reduction, the threads need to work together. For example, in a 1D reduction, you have threads that process elements in pairs, then combine the results, and so on.

But in this case, since the row is of length N, perhaps the block size is set to 128, and each thread in the block is responsible for a certain number of elements. But how to handle the reduction.

Alternatively, maybe the block

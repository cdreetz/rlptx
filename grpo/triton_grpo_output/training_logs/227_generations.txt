Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think through the steps.

First, the problem is to compute C = A * B, where A is MxK and B is KxN. The result C should be MxN. So each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

In Triton, I need to handle this with a kernel that can process these operations efficiently. Let me recall how Triton works. The kernel is written in a way that uses threads to process elements, with proper memory access patterns.

So, for each thread, I need to compute a part of the result. But how to structure the threads? Typically, for matrix multiplication, we can have each thread compute a single element of the result. However, that might not be the most efficient. Alternatively, we can use a block size that allows for efficient memory access, maybe using a loop over the K dimension.

Wait, in matrix multiplication, the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element of the output matrix. But for large K, this might be slow. However, Triton is optimized for this, so maybe that's the way to go.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. So for A, each row is contiguous in memory. Similarly for B.

The kernel needs to process each element of C. So for each i (row in A) and j (column in B), compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

In Triton, the kernel will have a loop over the K dimension. Each thread will handle one i and one j, and loop over k. But that's not efficient because for each thread, the loop over k would be a lot of operations. However, Triton can handle this with a loop in the kernel.

But wait, maybe there's a better way. Let me think about the block size. Let's say we have a block size of, say, 256. Each thread in the block can handle a certain range of i and j. But maybe that's not the case here. Alternatively, each thread can handle a single element of C, and the loop over k is handled in the kernel.

So, the kernel will have a loop over k, and for each k, load A[i][k] and B[k][j], multiply, and accumulate.

But how to structure the threads? Let me think about the parameters. The kernel will need to take the two input tensors and the output tensor. The kernel will be launched with grid dimensions that cover all M and N.

Wait, the kernel needs to be written in a way that each thread handles a specific i and j. So the kernel's parameters would be the M, N, K, and the input tensors. Then, for each thread, we compute C[i][j] as the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But how to map the thread indices to i and j? Let's say that each thread is responsible for a particular i and j. So the kernel is launched with a grid that has M * N threads. But that might be too many threads for large M and N, but Triton can handle it.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured with a block size that allows for multiple threads to work on different i and j. But for simplicity, maybe it's easier to have each thread compute a single element of C.

So the kernel would look something like this:

@triton.jit
def kernel(A, B, C, M, N, K):
    pid = tl.program_id(0)
    i = pid // N
    j = pid % N
    # compute sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]
    # but how to loop over k?

But wait, for each thread, we need to loop over k. So the kernel would have a loop over k, and for each k, load A[i][k] and B[k][j], multiply, and add to the result.

But how to handle the memory access? For A, each row is contiguous. So for a given i, the elements A[i][k] are at position i*K + k. Similarly for B, each column is contiguous. So for B[k][j], the position is k*N + j.

Wait, but in Triton, the memory layout is row-major. So for a tensor of shape [M, K], the memory is laid out as M rows, each of K elements. So the index for A[i][k] is i*K + k. Similarly for B, which is [K, N], the index for B[k][j] is k*N + j.

But in Triton, the

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works. The result should be a tensor of shape [M, N], where each element is the sum of the products of elements from the first matrix's row and the second matrix's column.

First, I should figure out the GPU operations required. Triton is a GPU programming language, so I need to use its primitives. The kernel will have to handle the computation for each element in the resulting matrix. 

The input tensors are A (M, K) and B (K, N). The output is C (M, N). Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. 

Now, considering the memory layout. Triton uses a grid of blocks, each block processing a portion of the data. For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to compute a part of the sum. 

The standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to have each thread compute a single element of the result. However, to optimize, we can use shared memory to store the relevant parts of A and B, reducing memory access latency. 

But wait, the problem here is that the matrices are [M, K] and [K, N]. So for each element C[i][j], we need to multiply A[i][k] with B[k][j] for all k. The key is to find a way to partition the work so that each thread handles a portion of the computation. 

Let me think about the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 is used. Let's say we use 32 threads per block. Each thread will handle a certain number of elements in the sum. But how to map the indices?

Another approach is to have each thread compute a single element of the result. However, that might not be efficient because each element requires K operations. So, perhaps using a block size that can handle multiple elements in the sum. 

Wait, maybe the standard approach is to use a block size that can process multiple elements in the sum. For example, if K is large, each thread can compute a few elements of the sum. But how to structure that.

Alternatively, for each thread, we can compute a single element of the result. So, the thread index in the block can be used to determine which element of the result it's responsible for. 

But how to handle the indices. Let's think about the indices. For each element C[i][j], the thread needs to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. 

In Triton, the kernel is written with a grid of blocks, and each block has threads. The threads can be assigned to compute specific elements. 

Let me think about the parameters. The kernel needs to take the input tensors A, B, and output tensor C. The shapes are M x K and K x N. 

The kernel will need to iterate over the rows of A (i) and columns of B (j), and for each pair (i, j), compute the sum over k. 

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a grid and a block. The threads are arranged in a way that each thread handles a specific part of the computation. 

So, the first step is to determine the grid and block dimensions. For example, the grid size would be (M, N), and each block would have a certain number of threads. But that might not be efficient. 

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured such that each thread computes a single element of the result. So, the number of threads in the grid would be M * N. However, that's not efficient because each thread would have to do K operations. 

But for large K, this would be slow. So, perhaps a better approach is to use a block size that can compute multiple elements in the sum. 

Wait, maybe the standard approach is to use a block size that can process multiple elements in the sum. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread can compute a portion of the sum. 

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured with each thread handling a single element of the result. Let me think about that. 

In this case, each thread would be responsible for computing C[i][j], where i is the row index and j is the column index. The thread's position in the block can be used to determine i and j. 

But how to map the thread index to i and j. For example, if the grid has M rows and N columns, then each thread's index in the grid can be used to compute i and j. 

But that's not directly possible because the grid is a 2D grid. So

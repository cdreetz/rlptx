Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by understanding what the problem is asking.

First, matrix multiplication between a matrix A (MxK) and matrix B (KxN) results in a matrix C (MxN). Each element C[i][j] is the sum of the products of elements from row i of A and column j of B. So, for each element in C, I need to compute the dot product of the corresponding row from A and column from B.

Now, thinking about how to implement this in Triton. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA, but with more abstraction. The kernel needs to handle the computation efficiently, considering memory access patterns and block sizes.

First, I need to determine the input and output tensor shapes. The input tensors are A (M rows, K columns) and B (K rows, N columns). The output tensor C will be M rows and N columns. So, the kernel will process each element of C by computing the dot product of the corresponding row in A and column in B.

Next, I need to think about the memory layout. The input tensors are likely stored in row-major order, which is the default for many GPU frameworks. So, A is stored as [M, K], and B as [K, N]. The output C will be [M, N].

Now, for the Triton kernel, I need to decide on the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 is common. Let's choose 32 as a starting point. Each thread in the block will handle a portion of the computation. However, since the problem is matrix multiplication, which is more efficient when using a grid of blocks where each block handles a submatrix, but in Triton, the kernel is written in a way that each thread handles a specific element.

Wait, no. In Triton, each thread is responsible for computing one element of the output matrix. So, for each element C[i][j], the thread would compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. However, this approach would have each thread compute one element, which is not the most efficient because it leads to a lot of memory accesses. But given that Triton is designed for this kind of task, perhaps that's the way to go.

But wait, in standard matrix multiplication, the optimal approach is to have each block handle a block of elements, and each thread computes a part of the dot product. However, for simplicity, maybe the kernel can be written where each thread computes one element of C. But that might not be the most efficient. Alternatively, perhaps the kernel can be structured to compute multiple elements in a block.

But given that the user hasn't specified any particular optimizations beyond the basic matrix multiplication, perhaps the straightforward approach is better. Let's proceed.

So, the kernel will have each thread compute one element of C. The thread index in the grid will be (i, j), where i is the row in C and j is the column in C. For each (i, j), the thread will compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But for this, the thread needs to access A[i][k] and B[k][j] for all k in 0 to K-1. However, in this case, each thread would need to loop through K elements, which could be slow if K is large. So, perhaps we need to use a more efficient approach, such as using a block of threads to compute a single element of C by sharing some data.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel can be structured with each thread block handling a single element of C, but that might not be efficient. Wait, maybe the standard approach for Triton matrix multiplication is to have each thread compute a part of the dot product, using shared memory to store the relevant parts of A and B.

But given the problem statement, perhaps the user just wants a basic kernel that computes each element of C by iterating over K. Let me think.

Let me outline the steps:

1. The kernel will have each thread compute one element of C. The thread index is (i, j), where i is the row in C and j is the column in C.

2. For each (i, j), the thread needs to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

3. The input tensors A and B are of shapes [M, K] and [K, N], respectively. The output C is [M, N].

4. The kernel will be called with the shapes of A, B, and C. The kernel will need to process all elements of C.

Now, considering the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to compute C = A * B, where A is MxK and B is KxN. The result C should be MxN. So each element C[i,j] is the sum over k of A[i,k] * B[k,j].

In Triton, I need to handle this with a kernel that can efficiently compute this. Let me recall how Triton works. The kernel is written in a way that uses threads to process elements of the matrix. Each thread might handle a particular element of the result matrix.

But wait, matrix multiplication is usually done with a loop over the inner dimension (K here). So for each i and j, we need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the inner dimension. However, since Triton is a GPU programming language, I need to make sure that the memory accesses are coalesced and that the threads are arranged in a way that maximizes throughput.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. So for A, each row is contiguous in memory. Similarly for B. So for each i and k, A[i][k] is at position i*K + k. Similarly for B[k][j], it's at position k*N + j.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the inner dimension. So for each thread, we need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But how to structure the threads? Let me think about the block size. Let's say each block processes a certain number of rows and columns. For example, each thread could handle a particular (i,j) pair, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, we can have each thread handle a particular k, but that's not the case here.

Wait, in matrix multiplication, a common approach is to have each thread compute one element of the result matrix. But that's not efficient because each element requires K operations. However, with Triton, using a loop over the inner dimension (k) is possible.

But how to structure the threads. Let me think about the dimensions. The kernel needs to process all i in 0..M-1 and j in 0..N-1. So for each i and j, we have to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the inner dimension. So the kernel would have a loop over k, and for each k, multiply A[i][k] and B[k][j], then accumulate the sum.

But how to map this to the threads. Let me think about the thread indices. Let's say that each thread is responsible for a particular (i,j) pair. Then, for each (i,j), the thread would loop over k from 0 to K-1, multiply A[i][k] and B[k][j], and add to the result.

But this approach would require that each thread has a loop over K elements. However, if K is large, this could be slow. But Triton is optimized for this kind of loop.

But wait, in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the inner dimension. So the kernel would look something like:

@triton.jit
def kernel(...):
    i = ...
    j = ...
    total = 0
    for k in range(K):
        a = tl.load(A[i, k])
        b = tl.load(B[k, j])
        total += a * b
    tl.store(C[i, j], total)

But how to map the threads to (i,j) pairs. The problem is that the number of threads needed is M*N, which could be large. However, Triton allows us to have multiple threads per block, and each thread can process a different (i,j) pair.

But for this, the kernel needs to be structured so that each thread is responsible for a particular (i,j) pair. However, this might not be efficient because each thread would have to loop over K elements. But if K is large, this could be a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps we can structure the kernel to have each thread handle a particular k, but that's not straightforward. Let me think again.

Another approach is to use a block size that allows for coalesced memory access. For example, each thread could be responsible for a particular k, and then process multiple (i,j) pairs. But this is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured with each thread handling a particular (i,j) pair, and then looping over k. But

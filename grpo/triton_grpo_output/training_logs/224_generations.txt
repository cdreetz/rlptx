Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through how to approach this.

First, the problem is to find the maximum value in each row of a 2D tensor. Since the tensor is [M, N], each row has N elements, and we want the max for each of the M rows. So for each row, we need to compute the maximum of N elements.

Now, considering Triton kernels, I need to structure the kernel to process these rows in parallel. The key is to figure out how to partition the work across the threads. Since each row is independent, each thread can handle a single row. But wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe each thread can handle a portion of the row. But for max reduction, each thread might need to process a subset of elements in the row and then combine the results.

Wait, but for a max reduction, each thread can take care of a certain number of elements in the row. For example, if we have BLOCK_SIZE = 256, then each thread can process a block of elements in the row. But since the row has N elements, we need to figure out how to divide the elements into blocks. However, since the max is a reduction, each thread would need to compute the max of its assigned elements and then combine with other threads' results.

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, but that would require a lot of threads. But for a 2D tensor, if each row has N elements, and there are M rows, the total number of elements is M*N. So for each row, we need to compute the max of N elements. So for each row, the kernel needs to process N elements.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let me think about the kernel parameters. The input tensor is 2D, with shape [M, N]. The output is a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the max of the corresponding row.

So the kernel needs to process each row. Let's think about the threads. Each thread can process a single row. But if the number of threads is less than M, then we need to have multiple threads per row. Wait, no. If we have M rows, then each thread can be assigned to a row. So the number of threads would be M. But if M is large, then each thread would process a row. However, for each row, the thread would need to process N elements.

But in Triton, the kernel is launched with a certain number of threads. So perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single row. Then, within that row, the thread needs to compute the max of N elements.

But how to do that. For example, for a row, the thread would need to iterate through all N elements and find the maximum. But that would be O(N) per row, which could be slow for large N. However, if N is large, then perhaps we can use a reduction approach where each thread processes a block of elements and then combines the results.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed to process each row in parallel. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The input tensor is a 2D tensor, and the output is a 1D tensor. The kernel needs to process each row.

So, the kernel's logic would be:

For each row i in 0..M-1:
   max_val = -infinity
   for each element j in 0..N-1:
       if input[i][j] > max_val:
           max_val = input[i][j]
   output[i] = max_val

But in Triton, we can't have loops in the kernel code. Instead, we need to use a block-based approach. So, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single row. Then, within the thread, we need to compute the max of that row.

But how to do that. For each row, the thread would need to read all N elements and find the max. However, if N is large, this would be slow. But perhaps for the purposes of this problem, we can assume that N is manageable. Alternatively, we can use a reduction approach where each thread processes a chunk of elements in the row and combines the results.

But for simplicity, maybe we can process each row in a way that each thread handles a single row. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The input tensor is of shape [M, N], and the output is [M].

In Triton, the kernel is launched with a certain number of threads. Let's say that each thread is responsible for a single row. So the number of threads is M. Then, for each thread, we need to process the elements in that row.

But how to do that. Let's think about

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the maximum element). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the max of N elements.

Next, the input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the max of the corresponding row.

Now, considering the Triton kernel structure. Triton kernels are written with a grid and a block, and each thread processes a certain element. Since we're doing a reduction along the last dimension, each thread will need to process a specific element in a row and compare it with others.

For the block size, I need to decide how many elements each thread block will handle. Since the last dimension is N, and each thread block can process multiple elements, maybe using a block size that divides N. But since N can be arbitrary, perhaps using a dynamic block size. However, in Triton, the block size is usually a fixed number. Alternatively, using a block size that's a power of two, but that might not be optimal for all N. Alternatively, using a block size that's the same as the number of elements per row, but that might not be efficient for large N. Wait, but for each row, the reduction is over N elements. So for each row, we can have multiple threads working on that row.

Wait, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. But that would require a lot of threads. Alternatively, using a reduction approach where each thread block handles a portion of the row.

Wait, perhaps the kernel should be structured such that each thread block handles one row. Then, within the block, the threads perform a reduction over the elements of that row. But that might not be efficient, because each row has N elements, and the number of threads per block would be N. But if N is large, that might not be feasible. Alternatively, using a more efficient approach where each thread block processes multiple elements in parallel.

Alternatively, think of it as a standard max reduction. For each row, we need to compute the maximum. So for each row, we can have a reduction over the N elements. The standard way to do this in Triton is to have each thread process a part of the data, and then combine the results.

But how to structure this. Let's think about the kernel parameters. The input tensor is [M, N], and the output is [M]. So for each row i (from 0 to M-1), we need to compute the max of the elements in row i.

So, the kernel needs to process each row. So perhaps the kernel is structured with each thread block handling one row. Then, within the block, the threads perform a reduction over the elements of that row.

But how to divide the work. Let's say that for each row, we have a certain number of threads. For example, if the block size is 1024, then each block can handle a row of N elements. But if N is larger than the block size, then we need to do multiple reductions. Wait, but that's the standard approach for reductions. So for each row, we can have a reduction where each thread is responsible for a subset of the elements, and then combine the results.

Alternatively, for each row, we can have a reduction where the threads are arranged in a way that allows for efficient parallelism. For example, using a warp-level reduction.

But perhaps the easiest way is to have each thread handle a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction across all elements. However, that would require that each thread has a unique index in the row. So for a row i, the elements are at positions (i, 0), (i, 1), ..., (i, N-1). Each thread would take one of these elements and compare it with others.

But how to do that. Let's think about the kernel code.

First, the kernel needs to process each row. So, the kernel's grid is determined by the number of rows M. Each thread block processes one row. Then, within the block, the threads perform a reduction over the elements of that row.

But how to arrange the threads in the block. For example, if the block size is 1024, then for a row with N elements, each thread would handle a subset of the elements. However, if N is not a multiple of the block size, we need to handle that. But perhaps the kernel is designed to process each row in a way that the threads in the block work

Okay, let's see. I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. So the input is a 2D tensor, and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row in the input.

First, I need to figure out what GPU operations are required. The main operation here is summing each row and then dividing by N. So for each row in the input tensor, I need to sum all the elements in that row and then divide by the number of columns N.

Now, considering the input and output shapes. The input is [M, N], and the output is [M]. So each row in the input contributes one value to the output.

Next, I need to think about the memory layout. The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. For each row, I need to access all N elements. The output will be a single value per row, so I need to compute the sum for each row and then divide by N.

Optimal block sizes and memory access patterns. Since each row is processed independently, I can process each row in a separate thread. However, since each row has N elements, the number of threads per block should be such that each thread handles a single element in the row. But wait, maybe it's better to have each thread handle a single element in the row, so that each thread can accumulate the sum for its row. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe process each row in a block, with multiple threads per block handling the elements of the row.

Wait, but for a 2D tensor, each row is of length N. So for each row, we can have a block of threads that process that row. But if the number of rows is M, then each block can handle one row. But if M is large, then we need multiple blocks. Alternatively, we can have each thread handle a single element in the row, but that would require a lot of threads per row. But maybe that's manageable.

But for performance, it's better to have each thread process a single element in the row. So for each row, each thread would add its element to the sum. But then, for each row, we need to have N threads, each adding one element. But if N is large, that could be a lot of threads. However, Triton can handle that.

Alternatively, maybe we can process each row in a block, with multiple threads per block. For example, if each block has BLOCK_SIZE threads, then each block can process a row of N elements. But if N is larger than the block size, then we need to have multiple threads per block working on the same row. So for each row, the threads in the block would process the elements in that row. But how to handle that?

Wait, maybe the best approach is to have each thread process a single element in the row. So for each row, each thread would add the element to a shared sum. But that would require that each thread in the block is responsible for a single element in the row. So for a row of N elements, the number of threads per block would be N. But if N is large, then the block size would need to be large. However, in Triton, the block size is a parameter that can be adjusted. So perhaps we can set a block size that is a multiple of the number of elements per row. But that depends on the input.

Alternatively, maybe the block size is fixed, say 256, and for each row, the threads in the block process the elements in that row. For example, if the row has N elements, then each thread in the block would process a single element. So for each row, the threads in the block would process the elements in that row. But how to map the threads to the elements in the row.

Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread handle a single element in the row, and the block is responsible for processing one row. So for each row, we have a block of threads, each thread handling one element. But if the row has N elements, then the number of threads per block would be N. However, if N is larger than the block size, then this approach would require multiple blocks per row, which might not be efficient. But Triton can handle that.

Alternatively, maybe the block size is set to a fixed value, and for each row, the threads in the block process a subset of the elements. For example, if the block size is 256, then each block can process up to 256 elements in a row. But this would require that each block processes a chunk of the row. However, that might complicate the code, as we need to handle the case where the row's length is not a multiple

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to calculate the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. Since the tensor is [M, N], each row has N elements, and we want to compute the average for each row. So for each row (i.e., each row index m), we need to sum all elements in that row and then divide by N.

Now, considering how Triton works, I need to structure the kernel to process each row. The kernel will have threads processing elements in a row. Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensor is 2D, so each thread will process a particular element in a row. But since we need to sum all elements in a row, each thread will need to access the elements in that row.

Wait, but in Triton, each thread is responsible for a single element. However, for a row, there are N elements. So if I have a block size that can process multiple elements per thread, but maybe it's better to have each thread process one element. But then, for each row, there are N elements, so the number of threads per row would be N. But if the block size is set to a certain value, maybe we can have multiple threads per row.

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. So for each row, each thread handles one element. But then, for a row with N elements, we need N threads. But how does that fit into the block size?

Wait, the block size is usually chosen based on the number of elements per row. Let me think: if each thread processes one element, then the block size would be the number of elements per row. But that might not be efficient if the block size is too large. Alternatively, maybe we can use a block size that is a multiple of the number of elements per row. Hmm, but perhaps it's better to have each thread handle one element, and then each thread adds its value to a shared sum.

Wait, but for a row, each thread would need to add its element to a sum. So for each row, we can have multiple threads, each handling one element. Then, the sum is computed across all threads in the block. Then, after the sum is computed, we divide by N.

So the steps would be:

1. For each row m, process all elements in that row (columns 0 to N-1).
2. Each thread in the block handles one element in the row.
3. Each thread loads the element from the input tensor.
4. The threads in the block sum all their elements.
5. After the sum is computed, the result is divided by N to get the mean.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let's think about the kernel parameters. The input tensor is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. The output is a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

In Triton, the kernel is written with a function that takes the input and output tensors, and the dimensions. The kernel will iterate over each row, and for each row, process all elements in that row.

But how to handle the threads. Let me think about the grid and block dimensions. The grid will have M blocks, each corresponding to a row. Each block will process all elements in that row.

But how to structure the threads. For each row, the number of elements is N. So, for each row, we can have a block with N threads. But in Triton, the block size is set via the @triton.jit decorator. So, perhaps the block size is set to a value that can handle the number of elements per row.

Alternatively, perhaps the block size is set to a value that is a multiple of the number of elements per row. But that might not be necessary. Let's think about the code structure.

The kernel will have a loop over the rows. For each row, the threads in the block will process the elements in that row. So, for each row m, the threads in the block will have an index in the row. For example, for a row m, the threads will process columns from 0 to N-1.

But how to compute the row index and the column index. Let's think about the parameters. The kernel will take the input tensor, output tensor, M, N. Then, each thread will compute its position in the row.

In the kernel, the first step is to determine which row the thread is processing. Then, for that row, the thread's column index is determined. But how to structure this.

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured with a loop over the rows, and within each row, a loop over the columns. But

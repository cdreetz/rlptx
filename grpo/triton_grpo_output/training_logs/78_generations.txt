Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations required. The task is to sum each column of the tensor. So for each column (which is along the N dimension), we need to add up all the elements in that column. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding column.

Next, input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor with dimensions M (rows) and N (columns). The output is a 1D tensor with M elements. The memory layout is important here. Since we're dealing with a 2D tensor, it's likely stored in row-major order, meaning that each row is stored contiguously in memory. So for a tensor of shape [M, N], the element at row i, column j is at position i*N + j.

Now, considering the kernel's structure. Triton kernels are written with a grid and a block structure. For this problem, I need to process each column. So each thread should handle a single column. But how to organize the threads?

Let me think about the block size. A common approach is to have each thread handle a single element in the column. But since we need to sum all elements in a column, maybe each thread can be responsible for a single element. However, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, we can have each thread process a range of elements in the column, but that's more complex. Wait, since we're summing all elements in a column, perhaps each thread can be assigned a specific column, and then sum all elements in that column. But how to do that in a parallel way.

Wait, no. For a sum reduction along the last dimension (columns), each thread should process a single column. But how to make sure that all elements in that column are summed. So each thread is responsible for a single column, and then the thread adds up all the elements in that column.

But how to do that. Let's think: For each column j (from 0 to N-1), each thread in the block would process that column. But how to assign the threads to columns. Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the column. But that would require multiple threads per column, which might be inefficient.

Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread handle a single column, and then sum all the elements in that column. But how to do that. Let me think again.

Wait, the kernel is supposed to compute the sum of each column. So for each column j, we need to sum all elements in that column. So for column j, the elements are at positions (0, j), (1, j), ..., (M-1, j). So the sum is the sum of all these elements.

So each thread can be assigned a specific column j. Then, for that column, the thread would iterate over all the rows (i from 0 to M-1) and add the value at (i, j) to the sum. But that would require each thread to process all elements in the column, which could be expensive if M is large. However, since each column is independent, maybe we can have each thread handle a single column, and then compute the sum for that column.

But how to structure the kernel. Let me think about the kernel's parameters. The input tensor is a 2D tensor, and the output is a 1D tensor of size M. The kernel needs to process each column, sum all elements in that column, and store the result in the output tensor.

So, for the kernel, the grid size would be determined by the number of columns, N. Each block would process one column. But how to compute the number of blocks. For example, if there are N columns, then the grid size would be N blocks. Each block would process one column.

But wait, in Triton, the kernel is launched with a grid size, which is determined by the number of columns. So the kernel would have a loop over the columns. Each thread in the block would process a single element in the column. Wait, no. Maybe each thread is responsible for a single column. So the kernel would have a loop over the columns, and each thread in the block would handle one column.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured with each thread processing a single element in the column. But that would require multiple threads per column. However, for summing all elements in a column, each thread would need to add the element to a shared sum. But that's more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single column. Then, for that column, the thread would sum all the elements in that column. But how to do that.

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum over the last dimension, which is N. So for each row in the tensor (each row is of length N), we need to sum all the elements. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding row.

Next, input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor with M rows and N columns. The output is a 1D tensor with M elements. The memory layout is important here. The input tensor is likely stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. The output will be a 1D array where each element corresponds to the sum of a row.

Now, optimal block sizes and memory access patterns. Since we're processing each row, each threadblock should handle one row. The number of threads per block would depend on the number of elements in a row. For a row of N elements, if we have a block size that can process N elements, but since N can be large, maybe we can use a block size that's a multiple of the number of elements per row. However, since each row is processed independently, perhaps each threadblock handles one row. Wait, but if the row has N elements, and each thread in the block processes a portion of the row, that might be more efficient. Alternatively, if the block size is set to process one row, then each threadblock would handle one row. But how to split the elements in a row among threads?

Alternatively, for each row, we can have multiple threads processing different elements. For example, if the block size is 128, then each threadblock would process 128 elements in a row. But since each row has N elements, the number of threadblocks would be M (number of rows) multiplied by the number of threadblocks per row. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, the kernel needs to process all rows. So for each row, we need to sum its elements. So perhaps each threadblock is responsible for processing one row. But how many threads per block? If the row has N elements, then each thread in the block can process a portion of the row. For example, if the block size is 128, then each threadblock would handle a row of N elements, with each thread processing a chunk of elements. But that might not be efficient if N is not a multiple of the block size. Alternatively, maybe each threadblock is responsible for processing a single row, and each thread in the block processes a single element. But that would require that the number of threads per block is equal to N, which could be large. However, since N can be up to, say, 1024, using a block size of 128 would allow each threadblock to handle 128 elements per row, but that would require that each row is processed by multiple threadblocks. Wait, no. Wait, the kernel is written in a way that each threadblock processes a single row. So for a row of N elements, the number of threads per block would be the number of elements in the row. But that's not feasible if N is large. So maybe we need to split the row into chunks, and each threadblock processes a chunk of elements. But that complicates the code.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed such that each threadblock processes a single row. For example, if the number of rows M is divisible by the number of threadblocks, then each threadblock handles one row. But how to handle rows that are not divisible by the number of threadblocks? That's where masking comes in. So, the approach would be:

- Each threadblock processes one row.
- Each thread in the block processes one element in the row.
- The number of threads per block is equal to the number of elements in the row (N). However, if N is not a multiple of the block size, then some threads in the block would be inactive. But that's okay, as we can use masking to ignore those.

But wait, that's not efficient. Because if N is large, say 1024, then each threadblock would have 1024 threads, which is not feasible. So perhaps the block size is set to a fixed value, say 128, and each threadblock processes a chunk of elements in a row. But then, how to handle the rows? Maybe each threadblock is responsible for a certain range of rows. For example, if there are M rows, then the number of threadblocks is M, and each threadblock processes one row. But that's not possible if the number of threads per block is fixed

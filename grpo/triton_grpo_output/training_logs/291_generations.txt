Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in Triton.

First, the inputs are A (M,K) and B (K,N), and the output is C (M,N). Each element C[i,j] is the sum over k of A[i,k] * B[k,j]. But doing this naively would be too slow, so we need to use shared memory and tile-based computation.

In Triton, the kernel is written with threads per block. So I need to decide on the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 128 or 256 is common. Let's pick 128 for this example.

Next, the shared memory. Each thread will handle a tile of size, say, 16x16. Wait, but the tile size depends on the block size. Let me think. The block size is 128, so maybe each thread handles a 16x16 tile. But I need to make sure that the tiles fit into the shared memory.

For the matrix multiplication, each thread in the block will compute a portion of the output matrix. The key is to load the corresponding rows of A and columns of B into shared memory, then perform the multiplication and accumulation.

So, for each block, we'll have:

- A tile of size (tile_size, tile_size) from A.
- B tile of size (tile_size, tile_size) from B.

But wait, the actual dimensions might not align perfectly. So, the kernel needs to handle cases where the dimensions are not multiples of the tile size.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the block size (BLOCK_SIZE = 128).
2. Each thread in the block will compute a portion of the output matrix C.
3. The threads will load the corresponding rows of A and columns of B into shared memory.
4. Perform the multiplication and accumulation in shared memory.
5. Finally, write the accumulated results back to global memory.

But how to structure the threads. Let me think about the indices.

Each thread in the block will be responsible for computing a certain element of C. But in tile-based computation, each thread might handle a small tile. Alternatively, the threads could be grouped into blocks that handle tiles of A and B.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to have each block handle a tile of A and a tile of B. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block can handle a tile of size 16x16. So, the block will process a tile of A (rows) and a tile of B (columns), and compute the corresponding part of C.

But I need to make sure that the threads are arranged properly. Let's think of the threads as being responsible for a certain row in A and column in B. However, since we're using shared memory, each thread will load a portion of A and B into shared memory, then perform the multiplication.

Let me think about the steps in code:

- The kernel is launched with grid dimensions based on the input dimensions. For example, for M rows and N columns in C, the grid size would be (ceil(M / block_size), ceil(N / block_size)).

But in Triton, the kernel is written with the thread index (i, j) in the block. Wait, no. The kernel is written with the thread index (pid) in the block. So, each thread in the block has a unique index, and the kernel is structured to compute a specific element of C.

Alternatively, the kernel could be structured such that each thread computes a certain element of C. But that's the naive approach. For tile-based, the threads would be grouped into tiles.

Let me refer to standard Triton matrix multiplication examples. In standard Triton matrix multiplication, each thread is responsible for computing a single element of C. However, with shared memory, the threads load the corresponding rows of A and columns of B into shared memory, then perform the multiplication.

But in this case, since the problem is to use tile-based computation, the kernel should be structured with tiles. So, each block will process a tile of A and a tile of B, and compute the corresponding part of C.

So, the steps would be:

1. For each block, determine the tile of A and B that it's responsible for.
2. Load the tile of A into shared memory.
3. Load the tile of B into shared memory.
4. Compute the product of the tiles and accumulate into the corresponding part of C.

But how to structure the threads. Let me think of the block as processing a tile of size (tile_size, tile_size) in A and (tile_size, tile_size) in B. The number of threads

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The user mentioned using tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that matrix multiplication involves taking the dot product of rows from the first matrix and columns from the second matrix. So for each element in the resulting matrix of shape [M, N], I need to compute the sum of products of elements from the first matrix's row and the second matrix's column.

But since we're using shared memory, I should figure out how to partition the matrices into tiles. The idea is to load chunks of the matrices into shared memory to reduce global memory access latency. The block size (tile size) is important here. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a common block size is 32x32 or 16x16. Let me choose 32x32 for this example. So each thread block will handle a tile of size 32x32.

Now, the input tensors are [M, K] and [K, N]. Let's call them A and B. The output is [M, N], which I'll call C. The kernel needs to compute C[i][j] = sum_{k} A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But how to structure the threads? Each thread block will compute a block of C. Let's think about how to split the problem into tiles. For each tile of A (size 32x32) and B (size 32x32), the corresponding tile in C will be 32x32. So each thread block will handle a 32x32 block of C.

But wait, the threads in the block need to compute the dot product between a row of A and a column of B. So each thread in the block will compute one element of C. But how to assign the threads to these elements?

Alternatively, maybe each thread block handles a tile of A and a tile of B, and then computes the corresponding tile of C. For that, the threads in the block can be divided into two parts: one for computing the dot product between a row of A and a column of B.

But in Triton, each thread is responsible for a single element of C. So for each element C[i][j], the thread needs to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. However, with shared memory, we can load the relevant rows and columns into shared memory to compute this efficiently.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the tile size (BLOCK_SIZE). Let's say 32x32. So each thread block will process a tile of size 32x32 in A and B.

2. For each thread in the block, compute the index in the tile. For example, the thread index within the block can be used to determine which element of the tile it's responsible for.

3. Load the relevant rows of A into shared memory. Since each thread is responsible for a row in A, we can load each row into shared memory. Wait, but if the tile is 32x32, then each row of A in the tile is 32 elements. So each thread in the block can load a row of A into shared memory. But how many threads are there per row? If the block has 32 threads per row, then each row of A is loaded into shared memory.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of how many threads are in the block. Let's say the block has 32x32 threads. Then, each thread can be assigned to compute a specific element of C. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe the block is divided into two parts: one for the rows of A and one for the columns of B.

Alternatively, the block can be divided into two parts. For example, each thread in the block is responsible for computing a single element of C. But that would require each thread to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j], which could be done by loading the relevant elements from A and B into shared memory.

Wait, but for each element C[i][j], the thread needs to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So for that, the thread needs to have access to A[i][k] and B[k][j] for all k. However, if the tile size is 32x32, then for a given i and j, the k indices would be in the range [0, 31], assuming that the tile is 32x32. So each thread can compute the sum over k by loading the corresponding elements from A and B into shared memory.

But how to organize this? Let me think

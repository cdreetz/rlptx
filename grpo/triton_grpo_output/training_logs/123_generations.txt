Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is to calculate the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. Each row has N elements, so for each row (i), I need to sum all elements in that row and then divide by N. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M].

Now, considering Triton kernels, I need to figure out the grid and block sizes. Since it's a 2D tensor, each block can handle one row. So, each thread in the block can process one element in the row. But wait, maybe each thread can handle a single element, and then we can sum them up per row.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, if each thread processes one element, then each block can process N elements. But how many threads per block? Let me think. Let's say we have BLOCK_SIZE = 128. Then, each block can handle up to 128 elements. But since each row has N elements, we need to make sure that the block can process all elements in a row. However, if N is larger than BLOCK_SIZE, then multiple blocks would be needed per row. Wait, but maybe the kernel is designed such that each block processes one row. So, the number of blocks would be M, and each block processes one row.

But how to handle the threads within a block. For each row, the threads in the block would process each element in the row. So, for a row with N elements, each thread in the block would process one element. So, the number of threads per block would be N. But that's not feasible if N is large. Because if N is, say, 1024, then each block would have 1024 threads, which is more than the maximum of 1024 threads per block. So, that's not efficient.

Wait, maybe I should think of each thread processing a single element in the row. Then, for each row, the threads in the block would be responsible for summing the elements. But how to do that. Let's think of the kernel as processing each row. Each block is responsible for one row. So, the number of blocks is M. Each block has multiple threads, each thread handles one element in the row. Then, the threads in the block can sum the elements and then compute the mean.

But how to structure this. Let me think about the steps:

1. For each row i (from 0 to M-1), compute the sum of elements in that row.
2. Then, divide the sum by N to get the mean for that row.

So, the kernel needs to process each row. Let's assume that each block processes one row. So, the number of blocks is M. Each block has multiple threads, each thread handles one element in the row.

But how to map the threads to the elements. Let's say that for a given row i, the elements are in the tensor at positions (i, j) where j ranges from 0 to N-1. Each thread in the block would be responsible for a particular j. So, the thread index within the block (thread_idx) would correspond to j. Then, the thread can load the value from the tensor at (i, thread_idx), add it to a shared sum, and then after all threads have processed, the sum is divided by N.

But how to handle the shared memory. Let me think. Each block can have a shared memory array where each thread writes its element. Then, the threads can sum the values in shared memory. But for a row with N elements, the shared memory would need to hold N elements. However, if the number of threads per block is less than N, then some elements would be missed. So, perhaps the block size is chosen such that it can process all elements in a row. But that's not feasible if N is larger than the block size. So, maybe the block is responsible for processing a range of elements in the row.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed such that each thread processes a single element in the row, and the block is responsible for summing all elements in the row. So, each block has a shared sum variable, and each thread adds its element to that sum. Then, after all threads have done their work, the sum is computed, and the mean is calculated.

But how to handle the case where the number of threads per block is not equal to N. For example, if N is 1024 and the block size is 128, then each block would have 128 threads, but there are 1024 elements in the row. So, that's not possible. So, perhaps the block is responsible

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let's break this down.

First, the problem is to compute the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. So for each row (each M element), we sum all the N elements and then divide by N. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M].

Let me think about the GPU operations. Since Triton is a GPU programming language, I need to use shared memory and proper memory access patterns. The kernel will process each row, sum the elements, and then divide by N.

The input tensor is 2D, so I'll have to access each element in a row. For each row i, I need to sum elements from column 0 to N-1. The output will be a 1D tensor where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

Now, the input and output shapes. The input is [M, N], output is [M]. So for each row, we process N elements and compute one output value.

Next, block sizes. I should choose a block size that's efficient for the problem. Since each row has N elements, and we need to process all of them, maybe using a block size that can handle the elements in a way that minimizes bank conflicts. Let's say BLOCK_SIZE is 128, which is a common value for Triton kernels.

But wait, how do I handle the sum? For each row, the number of elements is N. If N is not a multiple of the block size, I need to handle that. But since the kernel is processing rows, maybe each thread can handle a portion of the row. However, since each row is processed independently, perhaps each thread can handle a single element. Wait, but that would be inefficient. Alternatively, maybe each thread block processes a single row, and within the block, the threads process the elements of that row.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, if the block size is 128, then each block can process up to 128 elements. But if N is larger than 128, then multiple threads per block would be needed. Alternatively, maybe each thread processes one element, and the block processes all elements of a row. But that depends on how the threads are arranged.

Alternatively, maybe each thread block processes a single row. So, for each row, the block has multiple threads that process each element in the row. For example, if the row has N elements, then each thread in the block handles one element. But that would require that the number of threads per block is equal to N. However, since N can vary, this might not be efficient. But in Triton, the kernel is launched with a certain number of blocks and threads per block. So maybe the kernel is designed to process each row, and each thread block handles one row, with threads per block being the number of elements in the row. But that's not possible because the number of threads per block is fixed. Wait, no, in Triton, the kernel is launched with a certain number of blocks and threads per block. So perhaps the kernel is designed to process each row, and for each row, the threads per block are set to process all elements of that row. But that's not possible unless the number of threads per block is variable, which it's not. So perhaps the kernel is designed to process each row, and for each row, the threads in the block process the elements of that row. But how to handle varying N?

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed to process each row, and each thread in the block handles one element of the row. So for a row with N elements, the number of threads per block is N. But since N can be different for each row, this approach may not be efficient. However, in Triton, the kernel is launched with a fixed number of threads per block. So perhaps the kernel is designed to process each row, and each thread block handles one row, with the threads in the block processing the elements of that row. But how to handle varying N?

For example, if the row has N elements, then the number of threads per block is N. But since the number of threads per block is fixed, this is not possible unless we can adjust it.

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is to compute the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. Since the tensor is [M, N], each row has N elements, and we need to sum each row and then divide by N. So, for each row i, the mean is sum(row_i) / N.

Now, considering Triton kernels, I need to structure the code to handle this efficiently. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **GPU Operations**: The main operations are summing elements in each row and then dividing by N. For each row, we'll need to load all N elements, sum them, and then divide by N. Since we're dealing with a 2D tensor, the rows are along the first dimension (M) and columns along the second (N).

2. **Input/Output Shapes**: The input tensor is [M, N], and the output will be a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

3. **Block Sizes and Memory Access**: For a 2D tensor, each block can process a row. The block size should be chosen to efficiently handle the N elements per row. Let's say each thread processes one element in the row. But if N is large, maybe we can have multiple threads per row. However, since the sum is needed, perhaps each thread can handle a portion of the row. Wait, but for a row of N elements, if each thread processes one element, then each row would have N threads. But with Triton, the block size is usually a multiple of the number of threads per block. So, perhaps we can set the block size to a value that allows each thread to process one element in the row. But if N is large, maybe we need to use a larger block size to process multiple elements per thread. Wait, but for summing, it's better to have each thread handle one element, so that the sum can be accumulated across threads. Alternatively, if the block size is larger, maybe we can have multiple threads per row, but that might complicate the summing.

Wait, for a row of N elements, each thread can take a chunk of elements. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block can process 128 elements. But since the row is of size N, the number of threads per block would be N / block_size. But that's not possible if N is not a multiple of block size. So perhaps the better approach is to have each thread process one element in the row. Then, each block processes a row, and each thread in the block handles one element. But how does that work with the block size?

Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread process a single element in the row, and then the block's shared memory can accumulate the sum. Wait, but for a row, the number of elements is N, so if each thread handles one element, then the number of threads per block would be N. But that's not feasible for large N. For example, if N is 1000, then each block would need 1000 threads, which is not possible. So that's a problem.

Wait, maybe the block size should be chosen such that each block can process a row. So for each row, we have a block of threads that process all elements in that row. But how to structure that.

Alternatively, perhaps the block size is set to a value that allows each block to process a row. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block can process 128 elements in a row. But since the row is of size N, the number of blocks per row would be ceil(N / 128). But that's not efficient because each block would process a portion of the row. However, this approach would require that each block processes a portion of the row and then sum those portions. But that's more complex.

Alternatively, maybe the block size is set to 1, and each thread processes one element. Then, for a row, each thread in the block processes one element, and the block's shared memory accumulates the sum. But that would require that each block is responsible for a single row. Wait, but how to map the rows to blocks.

Wait, the rows are along the first dimension. So for each row i, we can have a block that processes all elements in that row. So the number of blocks would be M, each block processing a row. But how to map the rows to blocks. For example, if M is 1000, then each block is responsible for one row. But how to structure the threads in the block to process the elements of that

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to compute the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. So for each row (each M element), we sum all the N elements and then divide by N. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M].

Now, considering GPU operations. Triton is a GPU programming language, so I need to use the triton library. The kernel will process each row. Each thread will handle one row. So, the threads should be grouped into blocks, each processing a row.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output is a 1D tensor of shape [M]. Each row in the input has N elements. The output has M elements, each being the mean of the corresponding row.

For memory layout, the input tensor is stored in row-major order. So, each row is contiguous in memory. The kernel needs to access all elements of a row. So, for a given row i, the elements are at positions i*N to i*N + N-1.

Now, block size. Since each thread processes one row, the number of threads per block should be equal to the number of rows M. But if M is large, we need to split into multiple blocks. However, in Triton, the number of blocks is determined by the number of rows. So, the kernel will launch with a number of blocks equal to the number of rows, and each block has one thread. Wait, no. Wait, in Triton, the number of threads per block is determined by the block size. So, if I have M rows, and each block processes one row, then the number of blocks is M. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe the block size is set to 1, so each thread handles one row. But that's possible.

But for efficiency, maybe we can have each block process multiple rows. However, since the rows are independent, it's better to have each thread process one row. So, the block size is 1. But that might not be optimal. Alternatively, maybe the block size is set to a larger number, but since each row is independent, the threads can process them in parallel. However, in Triton, the number of threads per block is determined by the block size. So, for example, if the block size is 1, then each block has one thread. So, the number of blocks is M. But that's possible.

But perhaps it's better to have each block process multiple rows. But that's not necessary here because the rows are independent. So, each thread can process one row. So, the block size is 1. However, in Triton, the number of threads per block is determined by the block size. So, for example, if the block size is 1, then each block has one thread. So, the number of blocks is M. But that might be inefficient for very large M. However, for the purpose of this problem, perhaps it's acceptable.

Now, the kernel needs to process each row. So, for each row i, the thread will load all N elements of that row, sum them, and then divide by N. The output is stored in a separate tensor.

So, the steps for each thread:

1. Determine the row index i. Since each thread is responsible for one row, i can be determined by the thread index in the block. But since the block size is 1, the thread index is 0, and the block index is i. Wait, in Triton, the kernel is launched with a number of blocks equal to the number of rows. Each block has one thread. So, the thread index is 0, and the block index is i. So, the row index is the block index.

So, in the kernel, the row index is the block index. So, for each block, the thread processes row i = block_idx.

Then, for that row, the thread needs to load all N elements. So, the input tensor is accessed as input_tensor[i * N + j], for j from 0 to N-1. Then sum all these elements.

But how to handle the memory access. Since the input is a 2D tensor, but in Triton, the kernel is written in terms of the tensor's memory layout. So, assuming that the input is a 1D tensor, with shape [M*N], then for row i, the elements are at positions i*N to i*N + N-1.

So, the thread will need to load all N elements of row i. Then sum them. Then divide by N.

But for each row, the number of elements is N. So, the thread

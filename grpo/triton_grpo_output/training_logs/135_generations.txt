Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that subtracts two 1D tensors element-wise. Let me start by understanding the problem. The user wants efficient memory access, so I should think about how to structure the kernel to minimize memory latency and maximize throughput.

First, the input tensors are 1D, size N. So each tensor has shape (N,). The kernel needs to compute output[i] = input1[i] - input2[i] for all i from 0 to N-1.

Now, Triton kernels work with threads in blocks. I need to decide on the block size. A common choice is to use a block size that's a power of two, like 256. But I should check if that's optimal for the problem. Since each thread processes one element, maybe each thread handles one element. Wait, but if the block size is 256, then each block can handle 256 elements. But if N is not a multiple of 256, there might be some padding. But for the kernel, it's okay as long as we handle the last few elements properly.

Next, memory layout. The input tensors are stored in row-major order, which is the default for Triton. So each thread will load the input1 and input2 elements at their respective indices. But how to handle the indices?

Each thread in the block will have a unique index. Let's say the block size is 256. The thread index within the block is i. Then the global index is block_id * block_size + i. But wait, the kernel is called with a grid size that's determined by the number of elements. So for N elements, the grid size would be ceil(N / block_size). But in Triton, the kernel is launched with a grid size that's computed based on the input size.

So the kernel needs to compute for each thread the position in the input tensors. Let me think: for each thread, the index is computed as i = tid + block_id * blockDim.x. Wait, no. In Triton, the thread index within the block is 'pid', and the block index is 'block_idx'. So the global index is block_idx * blockDim.x + pid. But the kernel is launched with a grid size that's determined by the number of elements. So for N elements, the grid size is (N + blockDim.x - 1) // blockDim.x.

So in the kernel, each thread will compute its position as idx = block_idx * blockDim.x + pid. Then, the input1 and input2 are accessed at idx. The output is stored at the same index.

But how to handle the output? The output tensor is of the same size as the inputs. So the kernel needs to write to the output tensor.

Now, for memory access. Each thread loads input1 and input2 from their respective indices. Then subtracts and stores the result in the output.

But wait, for each thread, the input1 and input2 are accessed once. So the memory access is straightforward. However, if the input tensors are stored in global memory, then each thread will load the value from global memory. But for large N, this could be slow. However, since each thread is handling one element, there's no way to do better than O(1) per element. So the memory access is sequential, which is good because it's cache-friendly.

But wait, in Triton, when you launch a kernel, the threads are arranged in a grid and blocks. So for each block, the threads process consecutive elements. So the memory access is sequential, which is optimal. Because each thread accesses the next element in order, which is good for memory bandwidth.

So the steps for the kernel:

1. Compute the index for the current thread: idx = block_idx * blockDim.x + pid.

But wait, in Triton, the block index is given by the 'block_idx' variable. So for each thread, the global index is block_idx * blockDim.x + pid. But the kernel is called with a grid size that's determined by the number of elements. So the kernel should compute the index for each thread.

But how to handle when N is not a multiple of the block size? The last block will have fewer threads, but that's okay because the kernel is designed to handle that.

So, in the kernel:

- For each thread, compute the index as idx = block_idx * blockDim.x + pid.

But wait, in Triton, the block_idx is determined by the grid size. So for example, if the grid has 10 blocks and each block has 256 threads, then the total number of threads is 10 * 256 = 2560. But if N is 2560, then each thread's index is correct. If N is 2561, then the last block will have 2561 -

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that subtracts two 1D tensors element-wise. Let me think through the steps.

First, the GPU operations. The kernel needs to take two input tensors, A and B, and compute C = A - B. Each element in C is the difference of corresponding elements in A and B. So, for each element in the input tensors, I need to load them, subtract, and store the result.

Next, input and output tensor shapes. Both A and B are 1D tensors of size N. The output C will also be 1D of size N. The memory layout is probably row-major, but since they're 1D, it's just a single dimension. So each element is accessed sequentially.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels use threads per block. Let's choose a block size that's a power of two, maybe 256. But I need to make sure that the threads can process the elements efficiently. Each thread should handle one element, so the number of threads per block would be the number of elements in the block. Wait, but if the total number of elements is N, then the number of blocks would be ceil(N / BLOCK_SIZE). Each thread in the block would process one element.

But wait, for a 1D tensor, each thread can compute one element. So the kernel should iterate over each element, load A[i], load B[i], subtract, and store C[i]. But how to handle the indices?

The kernel's loop would be over the elements. Each thread is responsible for a specific index. So the thread index in the block is the position in the tensor. For example, if the block has 256 threads, each thread handles a different index. But if N is not a multiple of 256, then the last block will have fewer threads.

But how to compute the index for each thread? The thread index within the block is i = tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE). Then, the global index is i + block_id * BLOCK_SIZE. But since the kernel is for a 1D tensor, the block_id can be computed as the block number, and each thread computes its position.

Wait, maybe the kernel should have a loop over the elements. For each element, the thread loads A and B, subtracts, and stores. But how to handle the indices? Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The kernel needs to know the size of the tensor, N. So the kernel will take N as an argument.

So the kernel will have parameters: N, A, B, C. Then, each thread computes its position in the tensor. The thread index is i = tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE). Then, the global index is i + block_id * BLOCK_SIZE. But since the kernel is for a 1D tensor, the block_id is determined by the total number of elements divided by the block size.

But in Triton, the kernel is launched with a number of blocks, which is determined by the total elements. So the kernel will have to compute the block index. Wait, perhaps the kernel is written to process each element in the tensor, and each thread handles one element. So for each thread, the index is computed as i = tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE), and then the global index is i + block_id * BLOCK_SIZE. But how to compute the block_id?

Alternatively, the kernel could have a loop that runs for each element. But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop that iterates over the elements. Wait, maybe the kernel is written with a loop that runs for the number of elements, but that's not how Triton works. Instead, each thread is responsible for a specific element. So the kernel is structured with a loop over the elements, but each thread processes one element. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

In Triton, the kernel is written with a loop that runs for the number of elements, but each thread is responsible for a specific element. So the kernel would have a loop that runs for each element, but that's not efficient. Instead, each thread computes its own index. So the kernel is structured as follows:

For each thread in the block:
    index = thread_id + block_id * BLOCK_SIZE
    if index < N:
        load A[index]
        load B[index]
        subtract
        store C[index]

But how to compute block_id and thread_id? The kernel is launched with a number of blocks, which is determined by the total number of elements. So for example, if N is 1024 and BLOCK_SIZE is 256, then there are 4 blocks. Each block has 256 threads. Each thread's index is computed as thread_id + block_id * BLOCK_SIZE. But the block_id is determined by the block number.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with

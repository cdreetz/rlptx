Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in the context of Triton.

First, the matrices are A (MxK) and B (KxN). The result is a matrix C (MxN) where each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k. But since we're using shared memory, we need to tile the matrices into blocks to reduce memory access latency.

In Triton, each kernel thread handles a block of elements. For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to compute a portion of the result. Typically, the block size is chosen such that each thread can process a small tile of the matrices.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. For shared memory, we'll need to load chunks of A and B into shared memory. The block size should be chosen such that each thread can access a small tile of A and B.

Let me consider the block size. For example, if we use a block size of 32, each thread might handle a 32x32 tile. But I need to make sure that the threads can compute the correct elements of the result. Wait, in matrix multiplication, each thread is responsible for a specific element in the result matrix. However, with tile-based computation, each thread might handle a portion of the computation.

Alternatively, perhaps each thread is responsible for a block of the result matrix. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the standard approach for matrix multiplication with shared memory. The standard approach is to split the matrices into tiles, load them into shared memory, and then perform the multiplication in shared memory, then write the result back to global memory.

But for Triton, each thread is a separate kernel thread, so each thread would handle a specific element in the result matrix. Wait, no, that's not efficient. Instead, each thread would compute a portion of the result matrix by multiplying a row of A with a column of B. But with shared memory, we can load a block of A and B into shared memory, then compute the dot product of that block.

Wait, perhaps the block size is chosen such that each thread computes a small tile. For example, each thread is responsible for a block of the result matrix. Let me think of the standard approach for matrix multiplication with shared memory. The idea is that each thread computes a part of the result by multiplying a row of A with a column of B. However, to optimize, we can use tiles. So, for each tile of A and B, we compute the corresponding part of C.

But in Triton, each thread is a separate kernel thread. So, perhaps each thread is responsible for a specific element in the result matrix. However, that would be inefficient because each element requires K operations. So, instead, we can use a block size that allows each thread to compute multiple elements.

Alternatively, maybe the block size is set such that each thread is responsible for a block of the result matrix. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread computes a 32x32 block of the result matrix. But how to do that?

Alternatively, think of the problem as follows: each thread is responsible for computing a single element of the result matrix. But with K being large, this would be slow. Therefore, we need to use shared memory to store a block of A and B, and compute the dot product of that block.

So, for example, each thread is responsible for a block of A and B. Let me think about the steps:

1. Load the A matrix into shared memory in tiles. Each tile is of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). Similarly for B.

2. Each thread in the kernel is responsible for a specific element in the result matrix. Wait, but that's not efficient. Alternatively, each thread is responsible for a block of the result matrix.

Alternatively, the standard approach is to have each thread compute a part of the result matrix by multiplying a row of A with a column of B. But with shared memory, we can load a block of A and B into shared memory, then compute the dot product of that block.

But for that, the block size must be such that each thread can process a small tile. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread can compute a 32x32 tile of the result matrix. However, this requires that the threads are arranged in a way that each thread handles a specific tile.

Alternatively, perhaps the block size is chosen as 32, and each thread is responsible for a single element in the result matrix. But that would require K operations per

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in Triton.

First, the input tensors are A (M x K) and B (K x N). The result is C (M x N), where each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k. But doing this naively would be too slow, so we need to use shared memory and tile-based computation.

In Triton, I'll need to use shared memory to store tiles of the input matrices. The idea is to partition the matrices into blocks (tiles) that fit into shared memory, then compute the dot product of the tiles.

Let me think about the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 elements per thread is common. Let's say each thread handles a block of size BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE. But I need to make sure that the blocks fit into shared memory. For example, if each tile is of size 16x16, then each thread would handle a 16x16 block.

Wait, but for matrix multiplication, the threads usually process a block of rows from A and columns from B. So maybe each thread is responsible for computing a single element of C. But that's not efficient. Instead, using a tile-based approach where each thread block computes a block of C.

Alternatively, for each thread, we can compute a block of elements in C. But I need to structure the kernel so that each thread handles a portion of the matrix.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the block size (BLOCK_SIZE). Let's choose 16 for this example. So each thread block will process a block of size BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE in the output matrix.

2. For each tile of A and B, load them into shared memory. Then compute the dot product between the corresponding tiles.

But how to split the matrices into tiles. Let's say each tile is of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). For matrix A (M x K), each tile is (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), so the number of tiles along the rows is ceil(M / BLOCK_SIZE), and similarly for columns.

But maybe the standard approach is to have each thread block process a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread block compute a block of C by processing a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. But I need to think about the layout.

Alternatively, for each thread, we can compute a single element of C. But that's not efficient. So, the tile-based approach is better.

Let me think about the shared memory. For each thread block, we can load a tile of A (say, of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE)) into shared memory, and a tile of B (also of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE)), then compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B.

Wait, but B is K x N. So for each tile of B, it's a block of K rows and N columns. But if the tile size is BLOCK_SIZE, then each tile of B would be (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), but that depends on how the tiles are divided.

Alternatively, maybe the tile size is determined by the number of elements that can be processed in parallel. Let's think of the kernel as follows:

Each thread block handles a block of rows from A (size BLOCK_SIZE) and a block of columns from B (size BLOCK_SIZE). Then, for each element in the resulting block of C, we compute the sum of products of the corresponding elements in A and B.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let me think of the kernel as follows:

Each thread in the block is responsible for computing a single element of C. But that's the naive approach. To make it efficient, we can use shared memory to store tiles of A and B, and then compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B.

Wait, maybe the standard approach is to have each thread block compute a block of C by processing a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. For example, if the block size is 16, then each thread block processes 16 rows of A and 16 columns of B, resulting in a 16x16 block of C.

But how to structure the kernel. Let's think of the kernel as follows:

For each row in A (i), and each column in B (j), compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. But to do this efficiently, we can split the computation into tiles.

Let me think of the

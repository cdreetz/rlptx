Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that does element-wise division of two 1D tensors. Let me think through the steps.

First, the GPU operations. The kernel needs to take two input tensors, A and B, and divide each element of A by the corresponding element in B. So for each index i, output[i] = A[i] / B[i]. But I have to make sure that division by zero is handled. Oh right, Triton kernels can't throw exceptions, so I need to handle that with masking.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. Both tensors are 1D, size N. So the kernel should process each element in order. The output tensor will be the same size as the inputs.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Triton uses a grid and blocks. For a 1D tensor, a single block can process multiple elements. Let's choose a block size, maybe 256. Each thread in the block will handle a single element. Wait, but if the block size is 256, then each thread processes one element. That's straightforward. But maybe using a larger block size could be better for cache efficiency, but for element-wise operations, it's probably okay to have each thread handle one element.

Memory access: The kernel needs to load A[i] and B[i] from global memory, perform the division, and store the result. Since the tensors are 1D, each thread can calculate its index as i = tid * stride + offset. Wait, but in Triton, the threads are in a warp, and each thread has a unique tid. So for a 1D tensor, each thread can compute its position as i = tid + offset. Wait, maybe the kernel is designed to process each element in sequence. So the kernel's grid is set to N, and each block processes one element. Wait, no. Wait, the kernel is written with a grid that has N elements, and each block processes one element. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe the kernel is written with a block size that can process multiple elements. But for element-wise operations, it's easier to have each thread process one element. Let me think.

Wait, in Triton, the kernel is written with a grid of size N, and each block processes one element. So for each thread in the block, the index is computed as i = tid. But maybe the kernel is written with a grid of size N, and each block processes a range of elements. But for element-wise operations, it's easier to have each thread handle one element. So the block size is 256, and each thread processes one element. But if the total number of elements is N, then the grid is set to N, and each block processes one element. Wait, but in Triton, the grid is determined by the number of elements, and each block processes one element. So the kernel would be written with a grid of size N, and each block has a single thread. But that's not efficient. Alternatively, maybe the kernel is written with a block size that can process multiple elements, but that would require more complex indexing.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is written with a block size of 256, and each thread processes one element. So for each thread, the index is computed as i = tid. But if the total number of elements is N, then the grid is set to N, and each block processes one element. Wait, but that would require that the number of blocks is N, which could be a lot. But for a 1D tensor, that's manageable.

But maybe a better approach is to have each block process a range of elements. For example, if the block size is 256, then each block processes 256 elements. But that would require that the kernel is written with a loop over the elements in the block. However, for element-wise operations, that's not necessary. So perhaps the simplest approach is to have each thread process one element. So the kernel is written with a grid of size N, and each block has one thread. But that's not efficient because each block has only one thread. Wait, no. In Triton, the grid is the number of blocks, and each block has multiple threads. So if the block size is 256, then each block has 256 threads. But for a 1D tensor, each thread would process one element. So the grid is determined by the number of elements divided by the block size, rounded up. But that's more complex. Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is written with a grid of size N, and each block has one thread. But that would be inefficient for large N, but for element-wise operations, it's manageable.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is written with a grid of size N, and each block has one thread. But in that case, the kernel would have a

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that does element-wise division of two 1D tensors. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the GPU operations. Triton kernels are written in a way that's similar to CUDA, but with some differences. The main thing is to process elements in blocks, using shared memory if needed. For element-wise operations, each thread can handle one element, but maybe there's a way to optimize with block size.

Input and output tensors: Both inputs are 1D, same size N. The output will be a 1D tensor of size N. So, the kernel needs to process each element in the input tensors and compute output[i] = input1[i] / input2[i].

Memory layout: The tensors are stored in row-major order, which is the default for Triton. So, each thread will access the elements in a contiguous manner. But since they're 1D, each thread's index is i = tid + blockIdx * blockDim.

Block size: Let's choose a block size that's a power of two, maybe 256. That's a common choice for Triton. Each thread will handle one element. So, the number of blocks would be ceil(N / BLOCK_SIZE).

Memory access: Each thread needs to load input1[i] and input2[i], then divide them. Since the tensors are 1D, the linear index for each element is i. So, for a thread with tid, the index is i = tid + blockIdx * blockDim. But wait, in Triton, the kernel is launched with a grid of blocks, and each block has threads. So, the kernel needs to handle the case where N is not a multiple of the block size. So, the threads in the last block will have to handle the remaining elements.

Edge cases: What if input2[i] is zero? Division by zero would cause an error. But the problem statement doesn't mention handling that. However, in practice, the user should ensure that input2 has no zeros. But the kernel should probably handle it with masking. Wait, but Triton doesn't have a built-in way to mask, but maybe we can use a mask to skip divisions where input2[i] is zero. However, the problem says to handle edge cases with proper masking. So, maybe we need to check if input2[i] is zero and skip the division? Or maybe the user expects that input2 is non-zero, but the kernel should handle it with a mask.

Wait, the problem says to handle edge cases with proper masking. So perhaps the kernel should check if input2[i] is zero and avoid division. But how to do that in Triton? Well, maybe we can use a mask that is true when input2[i] is not zero, and then perform the division only when the mask is true. But how to implement that.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel should compute the division, but if input2[i] is zero, it would cause an error. However, the user might not want that. So, perhaps the kernel should check if input2[i] is zero, and if so, set output[i] to zero or some other value. But the problem statement doesn't specify, so maybe the kernel should just proceed with division, and let the user handle the division by zero errors. But the problem says to handle edge cases with masking, so maybe we need to mask out the cases where input2[i] is zero.

Wait, but how to do that in Triton. Let me think. For each thread, we can load input1 and input2. Then, check if input2 is zero. If it is, then we can set output[i] to zero (or some other value), but how to do that. Alternatively, maybe the kernel should compute the division only when input2[i] is not zero, and otherwise set output[i] to zero. But how to implement that.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel should compute the division, but when input2[i] is zero, it would cause a division by zero error, which is a runtime error. But the problem says to handle edge cases with masking, so perhaps the kernel should use a mask to skip the division. But how to do that.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel should compute the division, but when input2[i] is zero, the result is undefined. So, perhaps the kernel should mask those cases. But how to do that in Triton.

Hmm, maybe the problem expects that the user ensures that input2 has no zeros, but the kernel should handle the case where input2[i] is zero by setting output[i] to zero. So, in that case, the code would check if input2[i] is zero, and if so, set output[i] to zero. Otherwise, perform the division.

So, in the kernel, for each thread:

i = tid + blockIdx * blockDim

if i >= N: return

input1_val =

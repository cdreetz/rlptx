Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through the steps.

First, the GPU operations. Matrix multiplication involves taking the dot product of rows from the first matrix and columns from the second. Since we're using shared memory, I'll need to load chunks (tiles) of the matrices into shared memory to optimize memory access.

The input tensors are A (M, K) and B (K, N). The output is C (M, N). Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

For tile-based computation, I'll divide the matrices into blocks. Let's choose a block size, say BLOCK_SIZE = 128. Each thread block will handle a tile of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). But since K is the dimension that's being multiplied, maybe the tiles should be of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) for A and B. Wait, the tiles for A would be of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) and for B also (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), but since B is KxN, maybe the tiles are (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) for each. But how does this fit into the matrix multiplication?

Each thread in the block will compute a part of the result. Let me think about the indices. For each thread, we need to compute a portion of the C matrix. The threads will be grouped into blocks, each handling a tile of A and B.

Wait, in matrix multiplication, each element of C is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So for each i and j, we need to compute that sum. But with shared memory, we can load a block of A and B into shared memory, then compute the dot product for that block.

So the steps would be:

1. For each block of threads, compute the tile of A and B that they can handle.
2. Load the tile of A into shared memory.
3. Load the tile of B into shared memory.
4. Compute the dot product of the tiles, which contributes to the C matrix.

But how to split the matrices into tiles? Let's assume that the tiles are of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). So for matrix A (M, K), each tile is of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), and similarly for B (K, N). However, since K is the dimension being multiplied, the tiles for A and B would be aligned along the K dimension.

Wait, maybe the tiles for A are (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) and for B are (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). Then, each thread block handles a tile of A and a tile of B. But how does this fit into the overall matrix dimensions?

Let me think about the indices. For each thread in the block, the thread index within the block is (thread_id_x, thread_id_y). The block's position in the matrix is determined by (block_id_m, block_id_k) for A and (block_id_k, block_id_n) for B. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, each thread block handles a tile of A and a tile of B. For example, the block is responsible for a region of A starting at (m_start, k_start) and of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). Similarly, for B, starting at (k_start, n_start) and of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). Then, the threads in the block compute the dot product between the A tile and B tile, contributing to the C matrix.

But how to map the threads to the elements of the tiles. Each thread would compute a part of the dot product. For example, each thread would compute a single element of the dot product, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, each thread could compute multiple elements by iterating over the K dimension.

Wait, perhaps the threads are arranged in a grid where each thread is responsible for a particular element in the C matrix. But that's not tile-based. So tile-based would involve dividing the matrices into tiles, and each tile is processed by a block of threads.

Let me look up how matrix multiplication is done in Triton. Typically, for a matrix multiplication, the kernel is structured with each thread block handling a tile of A and B. For example, each thread block is responsible for computing a block of C. The threads within the block compute the dot product of rows of A and columns of B.

But in this case, the matrices are A (M, K) and B (K, N). So the tiles would be of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) for A and (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) for B. Then, each thread block would compute a block of C of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in the context of GPUs, especially with Triton.

First, the problem is to compute C = A * B, where A is MxK and B is KxN. The result C will be MxN. The standard approach for matrix multiplication on GPUs is to use shared memory to store tiles of the matrices, which helps reduce memory latency and improve throughput.

So, the steps I need to take are:

1. **Understand the GPU operations**: Matrix multiplication involves a lot of floating-point operations. Using shared memory for tiles allows each thread block to handle a block of data, reducing the number of global memory accesses.

2. **Input/Output Tensor Shapes and Layouts**: The input tensors A and B are stored in global memory. The output tensor C is also in global memory. The kernel will compute each element of C by summing the products of corresponding elements from A and B. Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

3. **Optimal Block Sizes and Memory Access Patterns**: The block size should be chosen to maximize the utilization of shared memory. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 is used. The tile size (number of elements per tile) is often chosen based on the matrix dimensions. For example, if each tile is 16x16 elements, then each thread block can handle a 16x16 tile of A and B.

4. **Edge Cases and Masking**: If the matrix dimensions are not multiples of the tile size, there might be leftover elements that need to be handled. Also, when accessing elements that are out of bounds, we need to mask those accesses to avoid errors.

Now, considering the Triton kernel structure. The kernel will be written with a @triton.jit decorator. The kernel needs to handle the computation for each element in the output matrix C.

First, I need to define the parameters for the kernel. The input tensors A and B, and the output tensor C. The kernel will process a tile of A and B, compute the product, and store the result in C.

The shared memory will be used to store the tiles of A and B. Each thread block will handle a block of size (tile_size, tile_size). For example, if the tile size is 16, then each thread block will process a 16x16 tile of A and B.

Each thread in the block will compute a single element of the output matrix. However, since the matrix multiplication is done in a way that each thread block handles a block of rows and columns, the threads need to be organized in a way that they can compute the correct elements.

Wait, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread block computes a block of the output matrix. For example, each block handles a block of rows in A and a block of columns in B. But I need to think about how the threads are arranged.

Alternatively, in the standard approach, each thread block handles a block of rows in A and a block of columns in B. The threads in the block are arranged in a grid that allows them to compute the necessary elements.

But for the Triton kernel, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. Let me think of the kernel as follows:

The kernel is responsible for computing a portion of the output matrix C. Each thread in the block will compute a single element of C. However, to do this efficiently, the threads need to access the corresponding elements of A and B.

But with shared memory, the tiles of A and B are loaded into shared memory. Then, each thread in the block can compute the dot product between the rows of A and the columns of B.

Wait, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread block handles a block of rows in A and a block of columns in B. For example, if the tile size is 16, then each thread block handles 16 rows of A and 16 columns of B. Each thread in the block is responsible for computing a single element of the output matrix C.

But in that case, the threads would need to compute the dot product between the corresponding row of A and column of B. However, for that, the threads would need to access the elements of A and B in a way that allows them to compute the sum.

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured such that each thread block handles a tile of A and a tile of B. Then, each thread in the block computes a single element of the output matrix by multiplying the corresponding elements of A and B and summing them up.

But for that, the threads would need to have access to the tiles of A and B

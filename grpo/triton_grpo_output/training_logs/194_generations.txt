Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through the steps.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first matrix is MxK, the second is KxN, so the result should be MxN. But since we're using shared memory, I need to break down the computation into tiles. Triton kernels are good for this because they can handle parallelism efficiently.

So, the key steps would be:

1. **Understand the Input/Output Shapes**: The inputs are A (M,K) and B (K,N), output is C (M,N). Each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k.

2. **Memory Layout**: The tensors should be stored in row-major order. For Triton, it's important to have them in contiguous memory. So, A is stored as [M, K], B as [K, N], and C as [M, N].

3. **Tile-Based Computation**: To optimize, we can split the matrices into tiles. Let's say each tile is of size TILE_M x TILE_K for matrix A, and TILE_K x TILE_N for matrix B. But since K is the common dimension, maybe the tiles for A and B should be aligned with K. Wait, maybe the tiles for A and B are of size TILE_M x TILE_K and TILE_K x TILE_N respectively. Then, for each tile, we compute the product.

But in Triton, each thread block processes a portion of the matrix. So, the block size needs to be chosen such that each thread handles a certain part of the matrix. Let me think about the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, the block size is chosen as a multiple of the tile size. For example, if the tile size is 32x32, then the block size might be 128x128, but that depends on the hardware. However, in Triton, the block size is determined by the number of threads per block. So, perhaps the block size is set to 128, and each thread handles a certain number of elements.

But wait, in matrix multiplication, each thread typically computes one element of the result. However, with shared memory, we can compute multiple elements in parallel. So, perhaps the block size is set to a number of threads that can handle a tile. Let me think: for each tile, we can have a block that processes a certain number of rows and columns.

Alternatively, the block size is set to 128, and each thread is responsible for a small portion of the matrix. But I need to make sure that the shared memory is used efficiently.

Let me recall the standard approach for Triton matrix multiplication. The kernel usually has two stages: first, loading the A and B tiles into shared memory, then performing the multiplication. For each thread, it computes a single element of the result. However, with shared memory, we can compute multiple elements in parallel.

But in this case, since the problem is to use tile-based computation, maybe the approach is to split the matrices into tiles of size TILE_M x TILE_K and TILE_K x TILE_N, and compute the product for each tile. However, the exact details depend on the tile size and how the threads are arranged.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread block compute a block of the result matrix. For example, if the result matrix is MxN, then each thread block handles a portion of it. But given that the input matrices are MxK and KxN, the tile size for A and B would be TILE_M x TILE_K and TILE_K x TILE_N respectively. Then, the block size would be such that each thread block can process a TILE_M x TILE_N portion of the result.

But maybe I need to think in terms of the shared memory. The idea is that each thread block loads a tile of A and a tile of B into shared memory, then computes the product of those tiles, and writes the result back to global memory.

So, for example, if the tile size is TILE_M x TILE_K for A, and TILE_K x TILE_N for B, then each thread block would handle a TILE_M x TILE_N portion of the result matrix. However, the exact arrangement depends on the tile size.

But perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread block handle a TILE_M x TILE_N portion of the result matrix. Then, each thread in the block would compute one element of the result. However, with shared memory, the threads can compute multiple elements in parallel.

Wait, maybe the kernel is structured as follows:

- Each thread block is responsible for computing a block of the result matrix. The block size is chosen such that the threads can

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, matrix multiplication between A (MxK) and B (KxN) results in a C (MxN) matrix. Each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k. But doing this naively would be slow on GPU, so we need to optimize with shared memory and tiling.

Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for GPU execution. The key steps here are:

1. **GPU Operations**: We need to perform matrix multiplication using shared memory to reduce global memory access. Tiling will help in managing the data that fits into shared memory.

2. **Input/Output Shapes**: The inputs are A (M, K) and B (K, N). The output is C (M, N). The kernel needs to handle these shapes efficiently.

3. **Block Sizes and Memory Access**: The block size should be chosen such that each thread block can handle a tile of data. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 is common. But I need to decide based on the tile size. Let's say each tile is of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), which is a common approach.

4. **Shared Memory**: Each thread block will load a tile of A and B into shared memory. Then, each thread in the block computes a part of the result. The threads will compute the dot product of the rows of A and columns of B.

Now, let's think about the steps in the kernel:

- Each thread block handles a portion of the matrix. The block will process a tile of A and B. For example, if the tile size is (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), then each thread block will handle a tile of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) from A and B.

- The threads within the block will compute the dot product between a row of A and a column of B. But since A is MxK and B is KxN, the tiles need to be arranged so that each thread can compute a part of the result.

Wait, perhaps the tile size should be (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), where each thread block handles a tile of A (size BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE) and a tile of B (size BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE). Then, the threads in the block compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B.

But how does this fit into the overall matrix? Let me think. The matrix multiplication is A * B, so each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, for a block that handles rows i to i+BLOCK_SIZE-1 of A and columns j to j+BLOCK_SIZE-1 of B, the threads would compute the dot product between A's rows and B's columns.

But the tile size for A and B should be such that each tile is of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). So, each thread block will process a tile of A (size BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE) and a tile of B (size BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE), and compute the corresponding part of C.

Wait, but B is KxN. So for B, each tile would be of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), but since B is KxN, the tiles would be arranged in rows and columns. So, for example, if the block is responsible for rows i to i+BLOCK_SIZE-1 of A and columns j to j+BLOCK_SIZE-1 of B, then the tiles of A and B would be of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), and the result C would be (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE).

But how do we map the threads to the computation? Each thread in the block would compute a particular element of C. For example, if there are BLOCK_SIZE threads in each dimension, then each thread would compute a specific element of the result.

Alternatively, maybe the threads are arranged in a grid where each thread computes a single element of C. But that's not efficient. Instead, we need to have threads compute parts of the dot product.

So, for each thread in the block, we can have them compute a part of the dot product between a row of A and a column of B. For example, if the block is responsible for rows i to i+BLOCK_SIZE-1 of A and columns j to j+BLOCK_SIZE-1 of B, then each thread would compute the dot product between A's row i + thread's row index and B's column j + thread's column index.

Wait, perhaps the threads are arranged in a grid where each thread is responsible for a particular element of the result. But

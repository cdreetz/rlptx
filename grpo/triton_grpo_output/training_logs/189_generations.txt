Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the operation is matrix multiplication. So, the first tensor is A with shape (M, K) and the second is B with shape (K, N). The result should be a tensor C with shape (M, N), where each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k in 0 to K-1.

Now, considering Triton kernels, I need to figure out how to structure the kernel. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows for high-performance kernels. The key is to partition the problem into blocks that can be processed in parallel.

For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block matrix approach where each block handles a portion of the matrices. The standard approach uses a tile-based method, where each block processes a submatrix of A and B.

Let me think about the dimensions. The first matrix A has M rows and K columns. The second matrix B has K rows and N columns. The result C has M rows and N columns.

In Triton, each thread block will handle a certain number of rows and columns. The block size is usually chosen to maximize memory access efficiency. A common choice is to use a block size of 128, but that can vary based on the problem.

So, for each thread in the block, we need to compute one element of the result matrix. However, in matrix multiplication, each element requires K operations (summing over K elements). So, the number of threads per block should be such that each thread can handle a portion of the K elements.

Wait, but in standard matrix multiplication, each thread block handles a tile of the matrices. For example, each block might handle a tile of size (block_m, block_k) for A and (block_k, block_n) for B. But I need to think about how to structure this in Triton.

Alternatively, perhaps each thread in the block is responsible for computing a single element of C. But that would be inefficient because each element requires K operations. So, to optimize, we can use a block that processes multiple elements at once, using shared memory.

But given that Triton is a high-level language, maybe the standard approach is to use a block that processes a tile of A and B, and computes the corresponding tile of C. However, for the purposes of this problem, maybe the kernel is designed to compute each element of C, but with optimized memory access.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written in a way that each thread handles a part of the computation. Let me think of the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton.

In the standard approach, each thread block handles a tile of A and B. For example, each block processes a block of size (block_m, block_k) for A and (block_k, block_n) for B. The block size is typically chosen such that the number of threads per block is a multiple of the block size. For example, block size 128, with 16 threads per block for each dimension.

But perhaps for this problem, since the matrices are [M, K] and [K, N], the kernel would need to process each element of C by iterating over the K elements. However, the key is to make sure that the memory accesses are coalesced and that the threads are properly aligned.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread block handles a row of A and a column of B. But that's not quite right. Let me think again.

In matrix multiplication, each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, for each i and j, we need to compute this sum. If we have a thread per element, then each thread would need to compute this sum, but that would require K operations per thread, which is not efficient.

Therefore, the standard approach is to use a block that processes multiple elements at once, using shared memory to store the tiles of A and B. However, that requires that the matrices are large enough to fit into shared memory, which may not be the case here.

But given that the problem is to write a Triton kernel, perhaps the approach is to use a block that processes a tile of A and B, and computes the corresponding tile of C. However, for the purposes of this problem, maybe the kernel is designed to compute each element of C, but with optimized memory access.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is designed to compute the entire matrix multiplication, with each thread block handling a portion of the matrices. Let me try to outline the steps.

First, the kernel needs to take the input tensors A and B, and output tensor C. The shapes are (M, K) and

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by understanding what this entails.

First, the problem is to compute the product of two matrices A (MxK) and B (KxN), resulting in a matrix C (MxN). Each element C[i,j] is the sum over k of A[i,k] * B[k,j]. 

So, the kernel needs to handle this computation efficiently on the GPU using Triton. Let me think about the steps involved.

Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for parallelism. The key is to determine how to partition the computation into blocks, manage memory access patterns, and handle the loop variables correctly.

First, the input tensors A and B, and output tensor C. Their shapes are M x K and K x N, respectively. The output C will be M x N.

In Triton, each kernel launch is divided into blocks. For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to handle a portion of the computation. For example, each thread could compute a single element of C, but that's not efficient. Instead, we can use a block size that allows each thread to compute multiple elements, but that depends on the problem.

Wait, but for matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to compute a submatrix. However, since the problem here is to multiply two matrices, perhaps using a more standard approach where each thread computes a single element of C, but with proper memory access patterns.

But given that K can be large, maybe we need to use a block size that can handle multiple elements. Alternatively, since the problem is to compute C[i,j] = sum_k A[i,k] * B[k,j], each thread can handle one element of C. However, for that, each thread would need to iterate over k, which could be expensive if K is large.

Alternatively, we can use a block size that allows each thread to compute multiple elements. But that might complicate the code. Let me think about the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton.

In the standard approach for matrix multiplication, each thread block handles a block of elements. For example, each thread block might compute a portion of the matrix C. However, for the case where the matrices are of size M x K and K x N, the standard approach would involve having each thread block compute a submatrix of C. But given that the problem is to compute C[i,j] as the sum over k, perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element of C, but with proper memory access patterns.

But for that, the threads would need to iterate over the K elements. However, if K is large, this could be slow. Therefore, it's better to use a block size that can handle multiple elements in the inner loop. Alternatively, using a block size that allows each thread to process multiple elements of the inner loop.

But perhaps the standard approach for Triton matrix multiplication is to use a block size of 16 or 32, and each thread handles one element of C, but with proper memory access. However, in that case, the threads would need to iterate over the K elements for each element of C. That's O(K) per element, which could be slow if K is large. Therefore, maybe we need to optimize the inner loop.

Alternatively, using a more efficient approach where each thread block handles a block of K elements. For example, each thread block could process a block of K elements, and each thread in the block processes a part of that. But this depends on the problem.

Alternatively, think about the problem in terms of the indices. Each thread is responsible for computing a particular element of C. The indices for the thread would be i (row of C), j (column of C), and then the inner loop over k (the dimension that's summed over). However, for that, each thread would have to iterate over k from 0 to K-1, which could be slow if K is large.

But in Triton, the inner loop is handled by the kernel's code. So, for each thread, the code would have to loop over k, multiply A[i][k] and B[k][j], and accumulate the sum.

But in that case, the kernel would have to have a loop over k, which could be slow if K is large. Therefore, perhaps the optimal approach is to use a block size that allows the inner loop to be optimized.

Wait, but in the case of matrix multiplication, the standard approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to compute a portion of the inner loop. For example, using a block size of 16, and each thread computes 16 elements of the inner loop. However, that might not be possible here.

Alternatively, perhaps the

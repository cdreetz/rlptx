Okay, let's see. I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. So the input is a tensor of shape (M, N), and the output should be a tensor of shape (M, 1), where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

First, I need to figure out what GPU operations are needed. Since we're dealing with a 2D tensor and reducing along the last dimension (N), each row in the input tensor needs to be summed and then divided by N. So for each row, sum all elements in that row and then divide by N.

Now, thinking about the Triton kernel structure. The kernel will process each row. Each thread will handle one row. Wait, but how are the threads organized? Maybe each thread processes a single element in the row, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single row, but that depends on how the threads are divided.

Wait, in Triton, the kernel is divided into blocks. So, for a 2D tensor, perhaps each block handles a row. But since each row has N elements, the block size needs to be chosen such that each block can process a row. But maybe the block size is set to 1, and each thread processes one row. But that might not be optimal. Alternatively, maybe the block size is set to N, and each block processes all elements in a row. But that depends on the number of rows and columns.

Wait, the input is [M, N]. So for each row (i.e., each row index m), we need to sum all N elements in that row. So for each row, the thread(s) in the block will compute the sum.

So the kernel should iterate over each row. Let's think about the thread index. For each row m, the threads in the block will process the elements in that row. But how to organize the threads? Maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. But that would require that each thread in the block processes one element, and then the block sums them all.

Alternatively, maybe each block handles a row, and the threads in the block process the elements in that row. For example, if the block size is N, then each block handles a row, and each thread in the block processes one element. But that's not efficient because if N is large, the block size would be large, but Triton's blocks have a maximum size. Wait, the maximum block size in Triton is 1024. So if N is up to 1024, then a block can process a row. But if N is larger than that, maybe we need to split into multiple blocks. But for the general case, perhaps we can set the block size to a value that allows each block to process a row.

Alternatively, maybe the block size is set to 1, and each thread handles one row. But that's not efficient for large N. Hmm. Let me think again.

The key is that for each row m, we need to sum all N elements. So the kernel needs to process each row. So the threads should be organized such that each thread is responsible for a single row. But how?

Wait, perhaps the kernel is written with a loop over the rows. Each thread is assigned a row index m. Then, for each row m, the thread needs to load all N elements in that row, sum them, and then divide by N. But how to do that in Triton?

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured with a loop over the rows. For each row, the threads in the block process the elements in that row. For example, if the block size is 1024, and N is 1024, then each block can process a row. But if N is smaller than the block size, then each thread in the block processes a single element in the row. But how to handle that?

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured with a loop over the rows, and for each row, the threads in the block process the elements in that row. Let's think of the kernel as follows:

Each thread is responsible for a single element in a row. So for row m, each thread i in the block (0 <= i < N) processes the element at (m, i). Then, the block sums all these elements and divides by N.

But how to map the thread index to the row and element index?

Alternatively, the kernel can be written with two loops: one over the rows and one over the elements in the row. But that's not efficient in Triton, which is more suited for single-loop kernels with block-level parallelism.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is written with a loop over the rows, and for each row, the threads in the block process the elements in that row. For

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to calculate the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. So for each row (each M element), I need to sum all the elements in that row and then divide by N. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M].

Now, considering the GPU operations. Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for parallelism. Each thread will handle a specific element in the output. So, for each thread, I need to compute the sum of a row and then divide by N.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The input is [M, N], and the output is [M]. Each thread will process one row. So, the number of threads should be equal to M. Each thread will process N elements in the input row.

Memory layout: The input tensor is stored in row-major order. So, for a given row i, the elements are at positions i*N, i*N+1, ..., i*N + N-1. The output tensor will have one element per row.

Optimal block sizes: Since each thread processes a row, the block size should be such that each thread can handle one row. But in Triton, the block size is determined by the number of threads per block. So, if we have M rows, and each thread handles one row, then the number of threads per block should be such that it can handle all rows. However, Triton's kernel is launched with a certain number of threads per block, and the total number of threads is determined by the grid size. So, the kernel should be designed to process each row in a separate thread.

Wait, but for a 2D tensor, if each thread processes one row, then the number of threads per block can be set to the number of rows. But if M is large, then the number of blocks would be 1. But in practice, the kernel is launched with a grid size that's determined by the number of rows. So, the kernel will have one block, and each thread in the block handles one row.

But how to structure the kernel? Let's think about the parameters. The kernel will take the input tensor, the output tensor, and the number of rows M and columns N.

In Triton, the kernel is written with a @triton.jit decorator. The kernel function will have parameters for the input and output tensors, and the shapes M and N. The kernel will process each row.

So, for each thread, the index i is the row index. The thread will sum all elements in row i. Then, the output[i] = sum / N.

Now, the memory access. For each row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j, where j ranges from 0 to N-1. So, for each thread, we need to load all N elements from the input tensor, sum them, and then divide by N.

But how to handle this in Triton? The kernel will have a loop over the columns for each row. However, in Triton, the threads are organized into blocks, and each thread can have a loop over the columns. But if N is large, this could be inefficient. However, for a mean reduction, it's necessary to process all elements in the row.

So, the steps for each thread:

1. Get the row index i.
2. Initialize sum to 0.
3. For each column j in 0 to N-1:
   a. Load input[i][j] into a variable.
   b. Add it to sum.
4. After the loop, store sum / N into output[i].

But in Triton, the threads are processed in a way that each thread can have its own loop. However, for performance, we need to make sure that the memory accesses are coalesced. Since each row is contiguous in memory, accessing each element in the row in order should be coalesced.

But how to handle the loop? The kernel will have a loop over the columns for each row. However, in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop that is unrolled or not, depending on the block size. Alternatively, the kernel can be structured with a loop that runs for each column in the row.

But wait, in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop that is controlled by the thread index. For example, each thread can have a loop that runs for the number of columns. However, if the number of columns is large, this could be slow. But for the purpose of this problem, it's necessary.

So, the kernel will have a loop over the columns. For each thread, the row index is i, and the column index is j. But how to compute j? Well, since

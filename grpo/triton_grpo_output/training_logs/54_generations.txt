Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the maximum element). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the max of N elements.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the max of the corresponding row.

Memory layout: The input is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. For each row, we need to process all N elements. The output will be stored in a 1D array, with each element corresponding to a row.

Optimal block sizes: Since we're processing each row independently, we can use a block size that allows each thread to handle a portion of the row. But since the reduction is across the entire row, maybe we need to use a reduction pattern. However, since each row is processed independently, perhaps we can have each thread handle a single element and then reduce across the threads in the warp. Alternatively, since the row is of size N, we can have each thread process a part of the row, but that might complicate things. Wait, but for a max reduction, each thread can take care of a part of the row, and then perform a reduction across the threads.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, if we have a block size that can handle the reduction, maybe we can use a standard reduction approach. However, since each row is processed independently, perhaps each thread block can handle one row. But that might not be efficient if N is large. Alternatively, for each row, we can have multiple threads working on it, but that's more complex.

Alternatively, considering that each row is processed independently, maybe we can have each thread block handle one row. For example, if the number of rows M is divisible by the number of threads per block, then each block can process one row. But that depends on the block size. Let me think about the block size.

Let me think of the standard approach for reduction. For a reduction across N elements, each thread can take care of a portion of the elements, and then perform a reduction. For example, in a warp of 32 threads, each thread can take care of 32 elements, but that's not possible if N is not a multiple of 32. So perhaps using a reduction approach where each thread processes a single element, and then the threads reduce across the warp.

But in this case, since each row is processed independently, maybe each thread block can handle one row. So for each row, we have a block of threads that process the elements in that row. But how to structure that.

Alternatively, for each row, the threads can be arranged in a way that they process the elements in the row. Let's say that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. Then, the threads in the block can reduce the max across all elements in the row.

But for that, the block size needs to be such that each thread can process a single element. So for a row of N elements, the number of threads per block would be N. But that's not feasible for large N, as the block size is limited (max 1024 threads per block). So for N larger than 1024, we need to have multiple threads per block working on the same row.

Wait, but in Triton, each thread block can have up to 1024 threads. So if N is large, say 1024, then each thread can process one element. But if N is 2048, then each thread block can have 2048 threads, but that's not possible. So we need to use a reduction approach where threads in the block work together to compute the max.

So the approach would be: for each row, the threads in the block work together to compute the max of the row. The block size can be set to a value that allows for efficient reduction. For example, using a block size of 1024, and each thread handles a portion of the row.

But how to structure this. Let me think about the steps.

First, the kernel needs to process each row. So the first thing is to determine which row each thread is responsible for. For example, the row index can be determined by the thread index in the block. But since each block can handle one row, the row index can be determined by the block index.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is launched with a certain number of blocks. So for M rows, we

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the maximum value). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the max of N elements.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the max of the corresponding row.

Memory layout: The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. The output is a 1D array where each element corresponds to a row's maximum.

Optimal block sizes and memory access patterns. Since we're processing each row, we can process each row in a separate thread block. The number of threads per block should be chosen to efficiently process the elements in a row. For a row of N elements, a block size that is a power of two (like 256) would be efficient, but we need to consider the actual N. However, since N can vary, we might need to use a dynamic block size. But in Triton, the block size is fixed per kernel. Alternatively, we can use a block size that's a power of two, and handle cases where N is not a multiple of the block size by using masking.

Wait, but for each row, we need to process all N elements. So for each row, the threads in the block will process elements in that row. So the block size should be such that each thread handles a single element in the row. Wait, but that would be a lot of threads. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread handle a chunk of elements, but since we need to find the max, it's better to have each thread process a single element and compare with the current max.

Wait, the standard approach for max reduction is to have each thread compute a local max, then merge them. But for a row, each thread can take a portion of the elements and compute the max. However, since the row is contiguous in memory, we can process each element in the row.

So, for each row, we can have a block of threads that process the elements in that row. The number of threads per block would be the number of elements in the row, but that's not efficient. Alternatively, we can use a block size that's a power of two, and for each row, the threads process elements in that row. But how to handle varying N?

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed to process each row in a separate block. For example, if there are M rows, each block handles one row. But that would require that the number of blocks is M, and each block processes N elements. But that might not be efficient if N is large.

Alternatively, the kernel can be designed to process each row in a single block. So each block handles a row, and the number of threads per block is the number of elements in the row. But that's not possible because the block size is fixed. So perhaps the kernel is written with a block size that can handle varying N, using a dynamic approach.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is written with a block size that's a power of two, and for each row, the threads process elements in that row. For example, if the row has N elements, and the block size is 256, then each thread handles a portion of the elements. But for the max reduction, each thread would take a subset of elements and compute the max, then merge them.

But in this case, since the row is processed in a single block, the threads can be arranged in a way that each thread takes a chunk of elements and computes the max, then the threads merge the results.

But how to structure this in Triton.

Let me think about the steps again.

The kernel needs to process each row. For each row, we need to compute the max of N elements. So for each row, the threads in the block will process the elements of that row.

So, the kernel's loop over rows. For each row, the threads process the elements in that row.

So, the kernel will have a loop over rows, and for each row, a loop over elements in the row.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a grid of blocks, each block processing a portion of the data. So, perhaps the grid is determined by the number of rows, and each block processes a single row.

But how to structure that.

Alternatively, the kernel can be written with a grid of blocks, where each block is responsible for processing a single row. The number of blocks is M, and each block processes N elements in the row.

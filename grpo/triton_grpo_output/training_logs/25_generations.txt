Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to compute the product of two matrices A (MxK) and B (KxN), resulting in a matrix C (MxN). Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. 

So, the kernel needs to handle this computation efficiently on the GPU. Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for parallelism, so I need to structure the code to take advantage of that.

Let me recall how matrix multiplication is typically handled in Triton. The standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element of the result matrix. However, for efficiency, it's better to have each thread handle a block of elements, especially when the matrices are large. But since the problem here is general, maybe I should use a standard approach where each thread computes one element.

Wait, but for large matrices, using a single thread per element might not be efficient. However, given that Triton allows for dynamic programming, maybe I should proceed with the standard approach, using a block size that's manageable.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order, which is the default in most frameworks. So, for A, each row is contiguous in memory, and similarly for B. The output tensor C will also be stored in row-major order.

Now, the kernel needs to process each element of C. For each element C[i][j], we need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, for each i and j, the thread will iterate over k from 0 to K-1, multiply the corresponding elements from A and B, and accumulate the sum.

But wait, in Triton, each thread is responsible for a single element of the output. So, the kernel will have to loop over all i and j, and for each pair (i,j), compute the sum over k.

But how to structure the threads? Let's think about the grid and block dimensions. The grid will have M * N threads, each handling a single (i,j) pair. However, that's not efficient because for each (i,j), the thread would have to loop over K elements. But if K is large, this could be slow. However, given that the problem is general, perhaps this is the way to go.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a more optimized approach where each thread block handles a block of rows or columns. But for simplicity, perhaps the standard approach is better here.

So, the kernel will have each thread compute one element of C. The threads are arranged in a grid of M rows and N columns. Each thread is responsible for computing C[i][j], where i is the row index and j is the column index.

But how to map the threads to the indices? The kernel will have to take the i and j as parameters. However, in Triton, the kernel is launched with a grid of (M, N), and each thread is assigned (i, j). But how to handle that in the kernel code.

Wait, in Triton, the kernel is launched with a grid of (num_rows, num_cols), and each thread is identified by (i, j). So, for the matrix multiplication, the grid would be (M, N), and each thread computes C[i][j].

But then, for each (i,j), the thread has to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, the loop over k would be from 0 to K-1.

But how to handle the memory access. For each k, the thread would load A[i][k] and B[k][j], multiply them, and accumulate the sum.

But in Triton, the threads are in a block, and each thread has its own local memory. However, for this problem, since the threads are independent, we can process each (i,j) pair in parallel.

But wait, the problem is that for each (i,j), the thread has to access K elements from A and B. If K is large, this could be slow. However, given that the user hasn't specified any constraints on K, perhaps this is the way to go.

Now, the next step is to think about the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. So, for A, the element at (i,k) is located at A[i * K + k]. Similarly, for B, the element at (k,j) is located at B[k * N + j]. Wait, no. Wait, B is a KxN matrix. So, each row of B is of length N. So, the element B[k][

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works. The first tensor is MxK, the second is KxN, so the result should be MxN. Each element in the output is the sum of the products of elements from the rows of the first matrix and columns of the second matrix.

First, I need to figure out the GPU operations. Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for parallelism. So, I'll need to process each element of the resulting matrix by iterating over the K elements in the inner loop. But how to structure the threads?

In Triton, each thread can handle a specific element in the output matrix. So, each thread will compute one element of the result. The threads will be divided into blocks, and each block will handle a portion of the matrix.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors are stored in row-major order. So, for the first matrix (A), each row is contiguous in memory. Similarly for the second matrix (B). The output matrix (C) will be stored in row-major order as well.

Now, the key is to determine the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 is common. Let's say I choose 32 as the block size. Each thread in the block will compute one element of the result. But wait, maybe I should use a more efficient approach where each thread handles multiple elements. However, since the problem is to multiply two matrices, each element in the result is computed by summing over K elements. So, each thread will need to iterate over K elements, which could be expensive if K is large. But with Triton, we can use shared memory to store the elements that are needed for the computation, which can speed things up.

Wait, but the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to use shared memory for the A and B matrices. Each thread in the block loads a portion of A and B into shared memory, then computes the dot product. But in this case, since the matrices are MxK and KxN, the block size needs to be chosen such that each block can process a certain number of rows and columns.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread computes one element of the result. Let's think about the indices. For each element C[i][j], it's the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, for each thread, we need to compute this sum. But if K is large, this could be slow. However, with Triton, we can use a loop over k, and accumulate the sum.

But how to structure the threads. Let's say that each thread is responsible for computing one element of C. Then, the thread index in the block can be used to determine i and j. But how to map the thread index to i and j? For example, if the block is responsible for a certain range of rows and columns, but that might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured with each thread handling a specific row of A and column of B. But that's more like the standard matrix multiplication approach. Wait, in the standard approach, each block handles a block of rows and columns. But for this problem, since the matrices are MxK and KxN, maybe the block size is determined by the number of rows in A and columns in B.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is written such that each thread computes a single element of the output matrix. So, the thread index in the block is used to determine the row i and column j of the output. Then, for each element, the thread loops over k from 0 to K-1, multiplying A[i][k] and B[k][j], and summing them.

But with K being up to say 1024, looping over K elements per thread could be slow. However, if K is small, this is manageable. But for larger K, this approach might not be efficient. However, given that Triton is optimized for this, maybe this is acceptable.

So, the steps would be:

1. Determine the indices i and j for the current element in C. The thread index in the block can be used to determine i and j. For example, if the block is responsible for a certain range of rows and columns, but that's not straightforward. Alternatively, each thread is responsible for a single element, so the thread index in the block is used to compute i and j.

But how to map the thread index to i and j. Let's say that the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for computing C[i][j], where i is the row index and j is the column index. So, for the kernel, the input tensors A and B are

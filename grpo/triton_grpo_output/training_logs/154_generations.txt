Okay, let's see. I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. So the result should be a [M, N] tensor. 

First, I should recall how matrix multiplication works. Each element in the resulting matrix is the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix. So for each element (i, j) in the result, it's the sum over k from 0 to K-1 of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

Now, thinking about Triton kernels. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA, but with more high-level abstractions. The kernel needs to handle the computation efficiently, considering memory access patterns and block sizes.

Let me think about the input tensors. The first tensor A is of shape [M, K], and the second tensor B is [K, N]. The output tensor C will be [M, N]. So for each element in C, we need to compute the sum over K elements.

In Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. But for performance, it's better to use block-based computations. The standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to use a block size that allows efficient memory access, like 32 or 64 elements per block. But I need to decide on the block size here.

Let me consider the dimensions. Let's assume that the block size is 32. But how does that fit into the problem? Each thread can compute a single element of the result. However, that might not be efficient because each thread would have to compute K elements, which could be expensive if K is large. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread handle a portion of the K dimension.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element of the result. But that would require each thread to iterate over K elements, which could be slow. So maybe we need to optimize that by using a block size that allows for more efficient computation.

Alternatively, maybe we can split the K dimension into chunks that each thread can handle. For example, if K is large, each thread can compute a certain number of elements in the K dimension. But I need to think about how to structure this.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. So for A, each row is contiguous in memory. Similarly for B. The output tensor C is also row-major.

In Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. So the kernel will have to iterate over each element of the result matrix. But for each element (i, j), the thread needs to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But if we have a thread per element, then each thread would need to iterate over K elements. However, if K is large, this could be slow. So maybe we need to use a block size that allows for more efficient computation. For example, if each block processes multiple elements in the K dimension.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to compute a single element, but with proper memory access patterns. Let me check.

In the standard matrix multiplication Triton kernel, each thread computes one element of the result. The threads are arranged in a way that each thread is responsible for a specific (i, j) pair. However, for each (i, j), the thread has to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But if K is large, this could be slow. So, perhaps we can use a block size that allows each thread to compute multiple elements in the K dimension. For example, if the block size is 32, and each thread handles a certain number of k's. But how?

Alternatively, maybe we can use a block size that allows each thread to compute multiple elements in the K dimension, but that would require more complex indexing.

Alternatively, maybe the standard approach is to use a block size of 32, and each thread computes a single element. But then, for each element, the thread would have to loop over K elements. However, if K is large, this would be slow. So maybe we need to use a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the key is to use a block size that allows for each thread to compute multiple elements in the K dimension. For example, if each thread is responsible for a certain range of k's, then the number of threads per block would be determined by the number of k's that can be processed. But how to structure this?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to use a block size that allows for each thread to process a certain number of elements in the K dimension. For example, if K is 1024, then each thread can

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by understanding what's required here.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first matrix is MxK, the second is KxN, so the result should be MxN. Each element in the output is the sum of the products of elements from the rows of the first matrix and columns of the second matrix.

Now, thinking about how to implement this in Triton. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA, but with more abstraction. The key is to structure the kernel to efficiently utilize the GPU's parallelism.

Let me recall the steps for matrix multiplication in Triton. Typically, each thread block handles a block of rows and columns. For matrix multiplication, each thread might compute a single element of the result. However, to optimize, we can use shared memory to store the relevant parts of the input matrices, which reduces global memory access latency.

So, the plan is:

1. Each thread block will handle a block of rows from the first matrix (M) and a block of columns from the second matrix (N). The size of the block depends on the BLOCK_SIZE. Let's say we use a block size of 128, which is a common choice for Triton.

2. The threads within the block will compute elements of the result matrix. Each thread computes one element of the output matrix by multiplying corresponding elements from the first matrix's row and the second matrix's column, then summing them up.

3. To optimize memory access, we'll use shared memory. The first matrix's row (of size K) and the second matrix's column (of size K) will be loaded into shared memory. This way, each thread can access the required elements without waiting for global memory.

But wait, in matrix multiplication, each thread typically computes one element. So, for each element (i, j) in the output matrix, the thread would compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. However, if we use a block size of 128, each thread would handle a different k, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, perhaps we can structure the threads such that each thread computes a single element, but that might not be the most efficient way. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element of the output. But for that, each thread needs to access K elements from each of the two matrices. However, if K is large, that would be inefficient. So, using shared memory to store the relevant parts of the matrices is crucial.

So, the steps would be:

- For each block, we assign a row index i from the first matrix and a column index j from the second matrix. The block will compute the element (i, j) in the output matrix.

Wait, but in matrix multiplication, each block would compute a submatrix of the output. However, in the standard approach, each thread computes one element. So, perhaps the block size is such that each thread computes one element.

But how to structure the threads. Let me think again.

In the case of matrix multiplication, the standard approach in Triton is to have each thread block compute a block of the output matrix. However, for the given problem, since the input matrices are MxK and KxN, the output is MxN. So, the block size would need to handle a block of rows and columns.

Alternatively, each thread block could handle a block of rows from the first matrix and a block of columns from the second matrix. For example, if the block size is 128, then each thread block would handle a block of rows (say, 16 rows) and columns (say, 16 columns), but that might not fit well with the K dimension.

Alternatively, perhaps the block size is chosen such that each thread block processes a single row of the first matrix and a single column of the second matrix, but that would require each thread to compute one element. However, that would be inefficient if K is large.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element of the output. So, for each element (i, j), the thread would compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. But to do that, each thread needs to access K elements from A and K elements from B. If K is large, this would be slow. Hence, using shared memory to store the relevant parts of A and B.

So, the steps would be:

- For each thread in the block, compute the element (i, j) in the output matrix.

- Load the row i of A into shared memory.

- Load the column j of B into shared memory.

- Multiply and sum the elements.

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to compute the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. Since the tensor is [M, N], each row has N elements, and we want to compute the average of each row. So for each row i, we sum all elements in column 0 to N-1 and divide by N.

Now, considering Triton kernels, I need to figure out how to structure the kernel. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA, but with more flexibility. The kernel will process elements in blocks, and each block will handle a certain number of rows.

Let me think about the input and output. The input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

Next, the memory layout. The input tensor is stored in row-major order, which is the default for most GPU tensors. So each row is contiguous in memory. For each block, I need to process a row, sum its elements, and then divide by N.

Now, the block size. Let's decide on a block size. Since each row has N elements, and we need to process all elements in a row, the block size should be such that each thread can handle a portion of the row. However, since each row is processed independently, maybe each block handles one row. Wait, but if the block size is too small, we might have too many threads. Alternatively, perhaps each thread handles one element in the row. But that might not be efficient.

Alternatively, maybe each block processes a single row. Let's think: for each row, we have N elements. If we have a block that processes a row, then each thread in the block can process one element. But that would require that the number of threads per block is equal to N. However, N can be large, so maybe that's not efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread process a portion of the row, but that depends on how we split the elements.

Wait, but for the mean, we need to sum all elements in the row. So for each row, we need to sum N elements. Let me think about the kernel structure. The kernel will iterate over each row, and for each row, sum all elements in that row. Then, divide by N.

So, the kernel will have a loop over the rows. For each row, we need to sum all elements in that row. Let's think about how to structure the threads. Let's say each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. So for a row, each thread would load the element, add it to a sum, and then after all threads have processed their elements, the sum is divided by N.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let's think about the kernel parameters. The kernel will take the input tensor, the number of rows M, the number of columns N, and the output tensor.

In Triton, the kernel is written with a function that has parameters. The kernel will be called with the input tensor, M, N, and output tensor. Then, the kernel will process each row.

So, the kernel will have a loop over the rows. For each row, we need to sum all the elements in that row. Let's think about how to do that.

Each thread in a block can handle a single element in the row. So, for a row i, the thread index in the block (say, tid) would correspond to the column index in that row. So, for row i, the element is at (i, tid). But if the block has multiple threads, each thread would process one element. However, if the number of threads per block is larger than N, then we need to handle cases where tid is beyond N-1, which would be invalid.

So, the kernel will have a loop over the rows. For each row, we have a loop over the columns. But in Triton, we can't have nested loops directly. Instead, we can use a single loop over the rows, and within that, process each element in the row.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a single loop over the elements, but that's not straightforward. Let's think again.

Each row has N elements. So, for each row i, the elements are at positions (i, 0), (i, 1), ..., (i, N-1). So, for a given row i, the threads in the block can process each element. So, the kernel will have a loop over the rows, and for each row, the threads process each element in that row.

But how to structure that. Let's think about

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to compute the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. Since it's a mean along the last dimension, each row (which is of length N) needs to be summed and then divided by N. So, for each row in the input tensor, I need to sum all elements in that row and then divide by N.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

Now, considering the memory layout. The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. For each row, I need to process all N elements. The output will be one value per row.

Optimal block sizes and memory access patterns. Since each row has N elements, and we need to process all of them, the block size should be chosen such that each thread handles a portion of the row. However, since the kernel is for a 2D tensor, maybe we can use a block size that processes elements in a way that allows for coalesced memory access.

Wait, but for each row, the elements are contiguous. So, for each row, we can have threads that process each element. However, if we have multiple rows, each row's elements are contiguous. So, perhaps we can process each row in a way that each thread handles one element, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can process each row with a block that has multiple threads, each handling a part of the row.

But considering that the mean is computed per row, maybe it's better to have each thread handle a single element in the row. However, for N elements per row, if N is large, having each thread handle one element could be inefficient. Alternatively, perhaps we can process each row in a way that each block handles a row, and then compute the sum and mean for that row.

Wait, but in Triton, each thread is a warp, and each warp can have multiple threads. So, maybe the approach is to have each thread process a single element in the row. But for that, the block size would need to be set such that each thread handles one element. However, for a row of N elements, if the block size is 1, then each thread would process one element. But that might not be optimal. Alternatively, perhaps we can process each row in a block, with multiple threads per block, each handling a part of the row.

But given that the rows are of length N, and we need to sum them, maybe it's better to have each thread handle a single element. Let me think: for each row, we need to sum all N elements. So, for a row, if we have multiple threads, each can take a chunk of elements. But for a row of N elements, if the block size is set to, say, 128, then each block can process up to 128 elements. However, since each row is of length N, we need to make sure that the block can handle that.

Alternatively, maybe we can process each row in a way that each thread handles a single element. For example, for a row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j for j from 0 to N-1. So, for each row, the threads can iterate over j from 0 to N-1, and sum the elements. But how to structure this in Triton.

Wait, in Triton, each thread is a warp, but the kernel is written with a loop over the rows. So, perhaps the kernel is structured as follows: for each row, we process all elements in that row. So, the kernel will have a loop over the rows (M rows), and for each row, we process all N elements. But how to structure that in Triton.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed to process each element in the input tensor. So, for each element in the input, we can compute its contribution to the sum of its row. But that might be more efficient.

But let's think about the data layout. The input tensor is [M, N], so for row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j for j from 0 to N-1. So, for each row i, the elements are contiguous in memory.

So, for each row i, the sum is the sum of all elements in that row. Then, the mean is sum / N.

So, the kernel needs to compute for each row i, the sum of elements in row i, then divide by N.

Now, the approach would be:

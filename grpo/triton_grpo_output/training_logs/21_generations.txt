Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works. The result should be a tensor of shape [M, N], where each element (i, j) is the sum of the products of elements from the first matrix's row i and the second matrix's column j.

First, I need to figure out the GPU operations required. Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for parallelism, so I should structure the kernel to handle each element of the resulting matrix. The key is to use shared memory to reduce global memory access latency, which is crucial for performance.

Let me think about the input tensors. The first tensor A is of shape [M, K], and the second tensor B is [K, N]. The output tensor C will be [M, N]. Each element in C is computed as the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

In Triton, I'll need to handle the indices for each matrix. For each block, I'll process a certain number of rows (i) and columns (j) in the output matrix. The block size is important here. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 is common, but I need to choose a value that allows for efficient memory access and coalescing.

Let me decide on the block size. Let's say BLOCK_SIZE = 32. Each thread in the block will handle a specific i and j. Wait, but in matrix multiplication, each thread usually handles a single element of the result. However, with shared memory, we can load rows of A and columns of B into shared memory, which can be more efficient.

Wait, maybe I should structure the kernel such that each thread block handles a portion of the rows of A and columns of B. But for a standard matrix multiplication, each thread block would process a submatrix. Alternatively, perhaps each thread block handles a single row of A and a single column of B, but that might not be efficient.

Alternatively, the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element of C. But with shared memory, we can load rows of A into shared memory and columns of B into shared memory, then compute the sum. However, this requires that the threads in a block are arranged in a way that they can compute the sum efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I should split the problem into blocks where each block handles a certain number of rows and columns. For example, each thread block could handle a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. But I need to make sure that the threads in the block can compute the sum efficiently.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread computes a single element of C. Let's think about that. For each element C[i][j], we need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. If each thread is responsible for a single (i,j) pair, then the thread would need to iterate over k, multiply A[i][k] and B[k][j], and accumulate the sum. However, this approach would have a lot of threads, each doing a loop over k, which could be slow. So, perhaps using shared memory to load the rows of A and columns of B into shared memory would be better.

So, the plan is:

1. Each thread block handles a portion of the rows of A and columns of B. For example, each block processes a certain number of rows (say, 16) and columns (say, 16), but that depends on the block size.

Wait, maybe I should structure the kernel so that each thread block handles a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. Then, each thread in the block would compute a single element of C. But this requires that the threads in the block can access the necessary elements of A and B.

Alternatively, for each thread in the block, we can compute a single element of C by loading the corresponding row of A and column of B into shared memory, then compute the sum. But this would require that the threads in the block are arranged in a way that they can access the same elements.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread block process a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread block processes a block of rows (say, 16 rows) and columns (say, 16 columns). Then, each thread in the block computes a single element of C by loading the corresponding row of A and column of B into shared memory, then compute the sum.

But I need to think about the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in global memory. Each thread block will load a portion of A and B into shared memory

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by understanding what's required here.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first matrix is MxK, the second is KxN, so the result should be MxN. Each element in the result is the sum of the products of elements from the rows of the first matrix and columns of the second matrix.

Now, thinking about how to implement this in Triton. Triton is a high-performance GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA but with more abstraction. The key is to structure the kernel to efficiently use the GPU's memory and parallelism.

So, the steps I need to take:

1. **GPU Operations**: The kernel will need to perform element-wise multiplications and summations. For each element in the output matrix, we need to compute the dot product between a row of the first matrix and a column of the second matrix.

2. **Input/Output Shapes**: The input tensors are A (M, K) and B (K, N). The output tensor C (M, N) will be the result. Each element C[i][j] is sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

3. **Block Sizes and Memory Access**: Triton uses blocks of a certain size. For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to handle a portion of the computation. Typically, for MxK and KxN, the block size is chosen such that each thread computes a single element of the output. However, this might not be the most efficient. Alternatively, we can use a block size that allows each thread to compute multiple elements, but that might complicate the indexing. Let me think. For a standard approach, each thread computes one element of the result. So, the block size would be something like 256, and each thread handles one element. But the way the threads are arranged in the grid and blocks needs to be correct.

Wait, in Triton, the kernel is launched with a grid of (num_blocks_m, num_blocks_n), where each block handles a portion of the rows and columns. But for matrix multiplication, the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element of the result. So, for each element C[i][j], the thread would iterate over k from 0 to K-1, multiply A[i][k] and B[k][j], and sum them up.

But how to structure this in Triton. The kernel needs to take the input tensors A and B, and output tensor C. The kernel will need to process each element of C. However, in Triton, the kernel is written in a way that each thread handles a specific part of the computation.

So, the steps for each thread:

- For a given i (row in A) and j (column in B), compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But how to map the thread index to i and j. The kernel is launched with a grid that has a certain number of blocks in each dimension. For example, the number of blocks in the M dimension (rows of A) and N dimension (columns of B). Each block would handle a certain number of rows and columns. However, since each thread computes one element, the number of threads per block would be determined by the block size.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a grid of (num_blocks_m, num_blocks_n), and each block has a certain number of threads. For example, if the block size is 256, then each block would have 256 threads. But how to map the thread index within the block to the i and j.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for computing one element of the result. So, for each thread, the i and j are determined by the thread's position in the grid. However, the grid is determined by the number of rows and columns in the output matrix.

But in Triton, the kernel is launched with a grid that's determined by the number of rows and columns. For example, if the output is MxN, then the grid would be (M, N), and each thread in the grid computes one element. However, this might not be efficient because each thread would have to loop over K elements. But with K possibly being large, this could be slow. However, for the sake of this problem, perhaps we can proceed with that approach.

But wait, in the standard matrix multiplication, the kernel is often written with each thread handling a block of elements. For example, using a block size that allows each thread to compute a submatrix. But in this case, since the matrices are MxK and KxN, the standard approach is to have each thread

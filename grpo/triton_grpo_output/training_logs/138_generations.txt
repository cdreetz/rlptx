Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in Triton.

First, the input tensors are A (M, K) and B (K, N). The output is C (M, N), where each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k. But since we're using shared memory, I need to break this down into tiles. 

So, the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to use shared memory to store tiles of the input matrices. Each thread block handles a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. The tile size is usually determined by the block size, say 32x32. But since K can be large, we need to make sure that the tiles fit into shared memory.

Wait, the problem says tile-based computation with shared memory. So each thread block will process a tile of A and a tile of B. The key is to load these tiles into shared memory, then perform the multiplication and accumulation.

Let me think about the steps:

1. Determine the block size. Let's say each thread block processes a block of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K) for A and (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N) for B. But since we're using shared memory, the tile size should be such that the blocks fit into the shared memory. For example, if the block size is 32, then each tile is 32x32 elements. But the exact block size depends on the problem. Maybe I should use a standard block size like 32, but I need to adjust for the problem.

Wait, in the standard matrix multiplication, each thread block handles a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. So for A (M, K), each thread block would handle a block of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K), and for B (K, N), each thread block would handle a block of size (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N). But since K can be large, the tile size for B would be (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N), but that's not right. Wait, B is (K, N), so each tile of B would be (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N). But the threads in the block would compute the dot product between a row of A and a column of B.

Wait, maybe I need to split the problem into tiles. For example, each thread block computes a block of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N) in the output matrix C. But to do that, the threads in the block need to process a block of rows from A and columns from B. So the tile size for A would be (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K), and for B (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N). Then, each thread in the block computes a single element of C by multiplying a row from A and a column from B.

But how to organize the threads. Let me think: each thread in the block would be responsible for a specific element in the output matrix. So for each thread, the index in the output matrix is (i, j), where i is the row in A and j is the column in B. But since we're using shared memory, we need to load the tiles of A and B into shared memory.

So, the steps would be:

- For each thread block, compute the starting row and column in the output matrix.
- Load the corresponding tile of A into shared memory.
- Load the corresponding tile of B into shared memory.
- Perform the multiplication and accumulation for the output matrix.

But how to handle the indices. Let me think about the parameters for the kernel. The kernel should take the input tensors A and B, and the output tensor C. The kernel will be launched with grid dimensions based on the input shapes.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with the parameters for the grid and block. So, the kernel needs to handle the indices for each thread.

Let me outline the variables:

- The kernel will have parameters for the input tensors A, B, C, and their strides. But in Triton, the kernel is written with the input and output tensors, and their strides. So, the kernel will need to take the dimensions of the input tensors.

But for the kernel, the parameters would be:

- The input tensors A, B, C.
- The dimensions M, K, N.
- The block size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N).

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written with the parameters for the grid and block. So the kernel function would be called with the dimensions of the matrices, and the block size.

Alternatively, the kernel is written with the parameters for the grid and block. For example, the kernel would be called with the shape of

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in Triton.

First, the problem is to compute C = A * B, where A is MxK and B is KxN. The result C should be MxN. Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. 

In Triton, I need to structure the kernel to handle this efficiently. Since it's tile-based, I'll probably use shared memory to store tiles of the input matrices. The key is to partition the matrices into blocks (tiles) that fit into shared memory, then perform the multiplication on these tiles.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input matrices A and B will be stored in global memory. The kernel will process each tile of A and B, compute the product, and store the result in C. 

For the shared memory, I'll need to store a tile of A and a tile of B. The size of the tile depends on the block size. Let's choose a block size, say 128, which is a common choice for Triton kernels. But I need to make sure that the tile size fits into the shared memory. The block size should be a multiple of the warp size (usually 32). So maybe 128 is okay.

Each thread in the kernel will handle a specific element in the output matrix. But since we're using tiles, each thread might be responsible for a part of the tile. Wait, maybe I should structure the kernel such that each thread block handles a tile of the output matrix. Alternatively, each thread might be responsible for a single element in the output, but that's not efficient. So tile-based approach is better.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the tile size (block size). Let's say each tile is of size (block_size, block_size). For example, if block_size is 128, each tile is 128x128. But the actual tile size depends on the problem. For matrix multiplication, the tiles are usually square, but maybe not. Alternatively, the tile size could be determined by the block size and the number of elements per thread.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to use a block size that allows for efficient computation. For example, each thread block processes a tile of A and a tile of B. The threads in the block are responsible for computing the dot product between a row of A and a column of B.

But how to structure the threads? Let's think of each thread as handling a specific element in the output matrix. However, that would be too slow. Instead, each thread block handles a tile of the output matrix. For example, each thread block processes a tile of size (block_size, block_size) in the output matrix. But that might not be the case. Alternatively, the threads in the block process a block of the output matrix, and each thread computes a part of the dot product.

Alternatively, the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element of the output matrix. But that's not efficient. So, the tile-based approach is to split the matrices into tiles, and compute the product of tiles. For example, if the tile size is (tile_m, tile_k) for A and (tile_k, tile_n) for B, then the product of these tiles would be (tile_m, tile_n) for C. But how to structure that in Triton.

Alternatively, the kernel is structured such that each thread block handles a tile of A and a tile of B, and computes the product of these tiles. The threads in the block would be responsible for computing the dot product between rows of A and columns of B.

But maybe I should think of the kernel as follows: For each tile of A and B, compute the product and store it in C. Each thread in the block would compute a single element of the product. But that would be too slow. Alternatively, each thread block processes a block of the output matrix, and each thread computes a part of the product.

Alternatively, let's think about the standard matrix multiplication in Triton. The kernel is written with each thread handling a specific element in the output matrix. However, to optimize, we use shared memory to store tiles of A and B, and compute the dot product between rows of A and columns of B.

So, the steps would be:

- For each thread in the block, compute the index (i, j) in the output matrix C.
- Load the corresponding row of A into shared memory.
- Load the corresponding column of B into shared memory.
- Compute the dot product between the row of A and the column of B, storing the result in C.

But that's not efficient because each

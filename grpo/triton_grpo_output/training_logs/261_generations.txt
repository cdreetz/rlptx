Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is to calculate the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. Since the tensor is [M, N], each row has N elements. The mean for each row would be the sum of the elements divided by N. So, the kernel needs to process each row and compute the sum, then divide by N.

Let me think about the GPU operations. For each row, I need to sum all the elements in that row. Then, after summing, divide by N. But how to do this efficiently in Triton?

Triton kernels are written in a way that's similar to CUDA, using threads per block and blocks per grid. So, I need to decide on the block size. Let's say each block processes one row. Since each row has N elements, the number of threads per block should be N. But wait, if N is large, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each thread processes one element in the row. But that depends on how the data is laid out.

The input tensor is 2D, with shape [M, N]. So, for a given row i, the elements are at positions (i, 0), (i, 1), ..., (i, N-1). So, each row is a contiguous block in memory. So, for each row, the threads can process each element in that row.

But how to structure the kernel. Let me think about the kernel parameters. The kernel will take the input tensor, the output tensor, and the dimensions M and N. The kernel will process each row, sum the elements, then divide by N.

So, the steps for each thread:

1. For a given row i, each thread processes one element in that row.
2. Sum all elements in the row.
3. Divide the sum by N to get the mean.

But how to handle the threads. Let's say that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. So, for each row, there are N threads. But if N is large, that could be a lot of threads. Alternatively, maybe each block processes a row, and each thread in the block processes one element. So, the block size would be N, but that's not feasible if N is large. Wait, but in Triton, the block size is determined by the kernel's code. So, perhaps the kernel is designed to process each row, with each thread handling one element in the row.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread processes a single element, and the block processes multiple elements. But I think the more efficient way is to have each thread process one element in the row, and the block handles the row.

But how to compute the sum. For each row, the sum is the sum of all elements in that row. So, for each row, the threads in the block would add their respective elements to a shared sum.

Wait, but if each thread is responsible for one element in the row, then for a row with N elements, there are N threads. So, each thread would add their element to a shared sum. Then, after all threads have added, the sum is computed, and then divided by N.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let me think about the kernel parameters. The kernel needs to know the number of rows M and columns N. The input tensor is of shape [M, N], and the output is [M], since each row's mean is one value.

So, the kernel would be structured as follows:

- Each thread is responsible for a single element in a row.
- For each row, the threads in the block process the elements of that row.
- The block processes one row, and the threads in the block add their elements to a shared sum.

But how to determine which row each block is processing. Let me think about the grid and block dimensions. The grid should have M blocks, each processing one row. Each block has N threads, each processing one element in the row.

So, the kernel's grid is M blocks, and each block has N threads. But wait, if N is large, this could be a problem. But for Triton, the number of threads per block is up to 1024, so if N is larger than that, we need to adjust. But maybe the problem assumes that N is manageable.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed to process each row with a block size that's a multiple of the number of elements per row. But perhaps that's not the case. Let's proceed with the assumption that each block processes one row, with each thread handling one element in that row.

So, the kernel's code would look like this:

- The kernel is called with the input tensor, output tensor,

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, the input is a 2D tensor with dimensions M (rows) and N (columns). The goal is to compute the mean along the last dimension, which means for each row (since the last dimension is N), we sum all elements in that row and then divide by N. So, the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

Now, thinking about how to implement this in Triton. Triton kernels are written in a way that's similar to CUDA, using threads per block and blocks per grid. I need to decide on the block size. Since each row is processed independently, maybe each thread can handle a single element in the row. But wait, if I have N elements per row, and each thread processes one element, then for each row, we need N threads. But that might not be efficient if N is large. Alternatively, maybe we can process elements in chunks. However, since the mean is a simple sum divided by N, maybe it's better to process each element in the row and accumulate the sum.

Wait, but for each row, the sum is over N elements. So, for each row, we can have a thread that adds up all the elements. But if N is large, that might require many threads. Alternatively, maybe using a block per row, with multiple threads per block. Let's think about the block size.

Let me consider that each block processes one row. So, for each row, the block has multiple threads that process the elements in that row. For example, if the block size is 32, then each block can process 32 elements in a row. But since each row has N elements, the number of blocks needed would be ceil(M / blocks_per_row). Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, since each row is independent, we can have each thread process a single element in the row. So, for a row with N elements, we need N threads. But that might not be efficient if N is large. However, Triton's threads can be arranged in a way that each thread handles one element. But for a 2D tensor, the rows are M in number, and each row has N elements.

Wait, the problem is that for each row, we need to sum all N elements. So, for each row, we can have a thread that accumulates the sum. But if N is large, that would require a lot of threads. Alternatively, maybe we can process the elements in a way that each thread handles a chunk of elements. For example, if the block size is 32, then each block can process 32 elements in a row. But that would require that N is a multiple of 32. However, since Triton handles this with masking, maybe it's okay.

But perhaps the simplest approach is to have each thread process one element in the row. So, for each row, each thread is responsible for adding one element to the sum. Then, after all threads in the block have processed their elements, the block can compute the sum and then divide by N. But how to handle that.

Alternatively, perhaps each thread in the block is responsible for a single element in the row. So, for a row, the threads in the block would process each element. Then, the block's shared memory can accumulate the sum. But maybe that's more complex.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of each thread handling one element in the row. So, the kernel will have M rows, and for each row, each thread in the block processes one element. But that would require that the number of threads per block is equal to N. But that's not possible for all rows. So, perhaps the block size is set to N, but that's not feasible for varying N.

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. So, for each row, the threads in the block process each element. But how to map the thread index to the row and element.

Let me think about the grid and block dimensions. The grid will have M blocks, each block processing one row. Each block has a certain number of threads, say BLOCK_SIZE. For each block, the threads process the elements in the row. So, for a row with N elements, the threads in the block will process each element. But if the block size is smaller than N, then multiple blocks would be needed for a single row. Wait, no. If the block size is set to N, then each block processes a row. But that's not possible if N is large, but Triton can handle that.

Wait, but the kernel is written in a way that

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the min reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the minimum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor). So for each row (each M element), I need to find the minimum of the N elements in that row.

Next, input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Memory layout: The input tensor is stored in row-major order, which is standard for CUDA. So each row is contiguous in memory. The output tensor will be a 1D array where each element corresponds to a row's minimum.

Optimal block sizes and memory access patterns. Since we're processing rows, each thread should handle a single row. But wait, in Triton, threads are grouped into blocks. So maybe each block processes a single row. But how many threads per block? Let's think: if each block processes one row, then the number of threads per block would be N (the number of elements per row). But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each thread handles a single element in the row, and the block processes all elements in a row. But for min reduction, we need to find the minimum across all elements in the row. So perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element, and then we perform a reduction across the threads in the block.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, if we have a block with N threads, each thread can take care of one element. Then, the block can perform a reduction to find the minimum. But how to structure that.

Alternatively, maybe we can process each row in a block. Let's think about the block size. Let's say each block processes one row. Then, the number of threads per block would be N, but that's not efficient if N is large. But for a row of N elements, if each thread is responsible for one element, then the block can compute the minimum of all elements in the row. But how to do that in Triton.

Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread handle a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction across the threads in the block. For example, if the block has 1024 threads, then each thread can take care of a single element, and then the block reduces them to find the minimum.

But for a row of N elements, the number of threads in the block should be at least N. But if N is large, that might not be feasible. However, since Triton allows for dynamic block sizes, perhaps we can set the block size to a value that can handle the row size. But maybe it's better to have each thread handle a single element in the row, and then the block reduces them.

So the plan is: for each row, each thread in the block handles one element. Then, the block reduces all the elements in the row to find the minimum.

But how to structure the code. Let me think.

First, the kernel will have to iterate over each row. For each row, the threads in the block will process each element in the row. Then, the block reduces the elements to find the minimum.

But how to handle the row index. Let's say that the kernel is launched with a grid of M blocks, each block handling one row. Then, each block will process the elements in that row.

But for each row, the number of threads in the block should be equal to the number of elements in the row (N). However, if N is not a multiple of the block size, that could be a problem. But maybe we can use a dynamic block size. Alternatively, we can use a block size that is a power of two, and handle the remainder.

Alternatively, maybe the block size is set to a fixed value, say 1024, and each thread in the block handles a single element in the row. Then, the block reduces the elements to find the minimum.

But how to handle the row index. Let's think about the kernel parameters. The kernel will need to know the shape of the input tensor (M, N), and the output tensor of shape (M).

So, the kernel function would be something like:

@triton.jit
def kernel(input, output, M, N):
    # code here

But how to handle the row index. Let's say that each thread is responsible for a single element in a row. But for each row, the threads in the block will process all elements in that row.

Wait, perhaps the kernel is structured as follows:

Each thread is assigned a row index (i) and a column index (j).

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the minimum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor). So for each row (each M element), we need to find the minimum of the N elements in that row.

Now, considering how Triton works, I need to structure the kernel to process the tensor efficiently. The kernel will run on the GPU, so I need to make sure that the memory access patterns are optimal, and that I'm using the right block sizes and threads per block.

Let me start by thinking about the input and output. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

In Triton, each thread will process a certain portion of the data. Since we're doing a reduction along the last dimension, each thread will need to process a column in the tensor. Wait, no. Wait, for each row, we need to find the minimum across all elements in that row. So for each row, there are N elements. So for each row, we need to find the minimum of N elements.

But how to do that in a parallel way. Let me think about the approach. For each row, we can have a reduction. But since each row is independent, perhaps each thread can handle a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction across the elements in the row.

But how to structure that. Let's think of the kernel as processing each row. So for each row, we have N elements. The reduction over those N elements would be done by a number of threads, perhaps using a reduction pattern.

But in Triton, the kernel is written in a way that each thread processes a certain element. So maybe the kernel will have multiple threads per row, each handling a part of the reduction.

Alternatively, since each row is independent, perhaps we can process each row in parallel. For example, each thread can be assigned to a row, and then perform a reduction over the elements in that row.

But how to structure the threads. Let me think about the block size. Let's say that each block processes one row. Then, the number of threads per block would be N, but that might be too large. Alternatively, maybe the block size is chosen such that each thread handles a certain number of elements in the row, and then perform a reduction.

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then the threads in the block perform a reduction to find the minimum. But that would require that each thread has a value, and then the block reduces those values.

But for a row of N elements, the number of threads in the block would need to be a power of two, so that the reduction can be done in log2(N) steps. However, for variable N, this might be tricky. But perhaps we can use a standard reduction pattern where each thread handles a certain element, and then the threads in the block reduce their values.

But how to handle this in Triton. Let's think of the kernel as follows: for each row, we have N elements. The kernel is designed to process each row. So the first thing is to determine which row each thread is responsible for. Then, for that row, the thread needs to process the elements and find the minimum.

But perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is assigned to a row, and then within that row, the thread is responsible for a certain element. Then, the threads in the block perform a reduction over the elements of the row.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, the number of threads in the block would need to be such that they can perform a reduction. For example, if N is 1024, then a block with 1024 threads would process each element, but that's a lot of threads. Alternatively, if the block size is 1024, then each thread can process a single element, and then the block reduces them all.

But that might be possible. Let me think about the steps:

1. For each row (M rows), process the elements in that row.
2. For each row, the elements are in the tensor. So for a given row i, the elements are at positions (i, 0), (i, 1), ..., (i, N-1).
3. The kernel needs to compute the minimum of these elements.

So, the kernel needs to process each row. So the first thing is to figure out which row each thread is assigned to. Let's say that the kernel is structured such that each thread is assigned to a row. Then, for that row, the thread processes a certain

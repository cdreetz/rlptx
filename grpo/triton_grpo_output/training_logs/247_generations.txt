Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. Matrix multiplication involves multiplying elements of the first matrix with corresponding elements of the second matrix and summing the products. Since we're using shared memory, I should structure the kernel to load chunks of data into shared memory to minimize global memory access.

The input tensors are A (M,K) and B (K,N). The output is C (M,N), where each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, for each element in C, we need to compute this sum.

Tile-based computation: I'll divide the matrices into tiles. Let's say each tile is of size BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE. For each tile in A and B, we'll load them into shared memory, compute the multiplication, and then write the results back to global memory.

But how to handle the indices? Let's think about the threads. Each thread block will handle a portion of the matrix. For example, each thread might be responsible for computing a single element in C. But with shared memory, we can compute multiple elements in parallel.

Wait, maybe it's better to have each thread block handle a block of rows in A and columns in B. Wait, no. Let me think again. In matrix multiplication, each thread can be responsible for computing a single element of C. But with shared memory, we can load a block of A and B into shared memory, then compute the product for multiple elements.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a block of threads to compute a block of C. For example, each thread block handles a block of rows in A and a block of columns in B. But I need to figure out the exact structure.

Let me recall the standard approach for Triton matrix multiplication. Typically, each thread computes a single element of C. However, using shared memory, we can load a tile of A and a tile of B into shared memory, then compute the product for all elements in that tile.

But for that, each thread would need to compute a part of the product. Let's say the tile size is BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE. So, for each tile of A (size BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE) and tile of B (size BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE), the product would be a tile of size BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE. Each thread in the block would compute a single element of the product.

Wait, but that would require that each thread is responsible for one element. However, with shared memory, we can load the tiles into shared memory, then for each element in the product, compute the sum over k.

But how to structure the threads. Let's think of each thread block as handling a block of rows in A and a block of columns in B. For example, if the block size is BLOCK_SIZE, then each thread block handles a block of size (BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE) in A and (BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE) in B, leading to a product block of (BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE) in C.

But that's not exactly right. Because the product of a (BLOCK_SIZE x K) matrix and a (K x BLOCK_SIZE) matrix would be (BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE). So, if the tiles are of size BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE, then each thread block can compute a tile of C.

But how to split the problem into tiles. Let me think of the matrices as being divided into tiles. For example, A is divided into tiles of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), and B is divided into tiles of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). Then, each tile in A is multiplied by each tile in B to produce a tile in C.

But the exact way to split depends on the problem. Alternatively, perhaps each thread block is responsible for computing a block of rows in C. For example, each thread block handles a block of rows in A and a block of columns in B, and computes the corresponding block in C.

But I need to make sure that the shared memory is used efficiently. Let me think about the steps:

1. Load a tile of A into shared memory.
2. Load a tile of B into shared memory.
3. Compute the product of the tiles, which is a tile of C.
4. Write the result back to global memory.

But for this, each thread would need to compute a single element of the product. So, the thread index within the block would determine which element in the product it's responsible for.

Alternatively, perhaps each thread is responsible for computing a single element of C. For example, if the thread block is responsible for computing a certain row in A and a certain column in B, then each thread in the block would compute the element at (i, j)

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through the steps.

First, the GPU operations. Matrix multiplication involves multiplying elements of the first matrix with corresponding elements of the second matrix and summing the products. Since we're using shared memory, I should split the matrices into tiles that fit into shared memory. The key is to compute the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix, but using shared memory to store these tiles to minimize global memory access.

Next, the input and output shapes. The first tensor is MxK, the second is KxN. The result should be MxN. The output tensor will be of shape [M, N]. So, each element in the output is the sum of products of elements from the first row and second column.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels typically use a block size that's a multiple of 32. Let's say each block handles a tile of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K) for the first matrix and (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N) for the second. Wait, maybe I should use a block size that allows for efficient tiling. For example, using a block size of 32, which is common for shared memory operations.

For shared memory, I need to load the tiles of the input matrices into shared memory. Each thread in the block will handle a portion of the tile. So, for the first matrix (A), each thread will load a row of A into shared memory. Similarly, for the second matrix (B), each thread will load a column of B into shared memory. Then, the dot product is computed between these tiles.

But how to structure the threads. Maybe each thread in the block is responsible for computing a single element of the output matrix. However, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, each thread could compute a part of the dot product. Wait, in tile-based computation, each thread block processes a tile of A and a tile of B. For example, if the block size is 32, then each tile is 32x32. But the exact size depends on the problem.

Wait, the standard approach for matrix multiplication with Triton is to use a block size that allows for computing the dot product of a row from A and a column from B. So, each thread in the block computes one element of the output matrix. But that's not tile-based. Hmm, maybe I need to split the matrices into tiles and compute the dot product between the tiles.

Alternatively, using a block size that allows for multiple elements to be computed in parallel. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread can compute a part of the dot product. Let me think of the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton.

In the standard approach, each thread block computes a tile of the output matrix. The tile size is typically (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N), where BLOCK_M and BLOCK_N are the number of rows and columns in the tile. The shared memory is used to store the tiles of A and B. Each thread in the block computes a single element of the output matrix by loading the corresponding elements from the shared memory and accumulating the sum.

Wait, but for that, the block size would be such that each thread is responsible for a single element. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread block can handle a tile of size (32, 32), and each thread computes one element. However, that might not be efficient if the tile is larger than the block size. Alternatively, the block size is chosen such that the number of threads in the block is sufficient to compute the dot product for each element.

But I'm getting confused. Let me recall the standard Triton matrix multiplication code. The standard approach uses a block size of 32, and each thread computes a single element of the output matrix. The shared memory is used to store the tiles of A and B. For example, the first matrix (A) is split into tiles of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K), and the second matrix (B) is split into tiles of size (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N). Each thread in the block handles a row of A and a column of B, computing their dot product.

Wait, maybe the block size is (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N), and each thread is responsible for a single element. But in that case, the block size would be larger. Alternatively, the block size is (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N), and each thread computes a part of the dot product. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread computes a part of the dot product by loading elements from the shared memory and summing them.

Alternatively, the block size is set to 32, and each

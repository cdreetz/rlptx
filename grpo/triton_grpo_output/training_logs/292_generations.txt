Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum each column of the tensor. So for each column (which is along the N dimension), we need to add up all the elements in that column. The input is a 2D tensor with M rows and N columns. The output should be a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the sum of the corresponding column.

Next, input and output tensor shapes. The input is [M, N], and the output is [M]. The memory layout is important. Since we're dealing with a 2D tensor, it's stored in row-major order. So each row is contiguous in memory. For a column-wise reduction, each thread should handle a single column.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels use warps and blocks. For a sum reduction, a common approach is to have each thread handle a single element in the column. But since we need to sum all elements in a column, each thread would need to load elements from the column and accumulate them. However, for efficiency, maybe we can have each thread handle a single element, and then have them combine their results. But since the kernel is for sum reduction, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element in the column, and then they add up their results.

Wait, but in a 2D tensor, each column is N elements. So for a column j, the elements are at positions (i, j) for i from 0 to M-1. So for each column j, we need to sum all M elements. So each thread could be responsible for a single element in the column. But how to organize this.

Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread handle a single column. But that might not be efficient. Wait, no. Because each column has M elements. If we have threads per column, then each thread would need to process all elements in that column. But that's not efficient. So perhaps the better approach is to have each thread process a single element in the column, and then combine their results.

But how to organize the threads. Let's think about the grid and blocks. The kernel should process each column. So for each column j, we need to sum all elements in that column. So the number of columns is N, and each column has M elements. So the kernel should have N columns, each processed by some threads.

But in Triton, the kernel is launched with a grid of threads. So maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the column. But how to map the threads to the columns.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured to have each thread handle a single column. But that would require that each thread processes all elements in that column. But that's not efficient because each thread would have to process M elements, which could be a lot. However, for a sum reduction, maybe it's manageable.

Wait, but for a 2D tensor, the sum along the last dimension (N) would be M elements in the output. So each output element is the sum of a column. So for each output element, we need to sum all elements in that column. So the kernel should process each column, and for each column, sum all its elements.

So the approach would be:

- For each column j (from 0 to N-1), sum all elements in that column.

But how to structure the threads. Let's think about the kernel's grid and blocks. Let's say we have a grid of size N, where each block handles one column. But that's not efficient, because each block would need to process M elements. Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured with each thread handling a single element in the column, and then combining their results.

But how to do that. Let's think of the kernel as follows:

Each thread is responsible for a single element in the column. So for each column j, each thread i in the block would process element (i, j). But that's not correct. Wait, no. If the column is j, then the elements are (0,j), (1,j), ..., (M-1,j). So for each column j, the threads would need to process all M elements. But if we have a block that processes a column, then each thread in the block would process one element in that column.

But how to map the threads to the columns. Let's say that the grid is launched with N blocks, each block handling a column. Then each block would have M elements to process. But that's not efficient because each block would have to process M elements. However, for a sum reduction, maybe it's manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum each column of the tensor. So for each column (which is along the N dimension), we need to add up all the elements in that column. The input is a 2D tensor with M rows and N columns. The output should be a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the sum of the corresponding column.

Next, input and output tensor shapes. The input is [M, N], and the output is [M]. The memory layout is probably row-major, so each row is contiguous in memory. For a 2D tensor, the elements are stored as [0, 0], [0, 1], ..., [0, N-1], [1, 0], etc. So for a given row i and column j, the index in the tensor is i * N + j.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels typically use a grid of blocks, each processing a certain number of elements. Since we're summing along the last dimension (columns), each block should handle a range of columns. But wait, the problem is that each column has M elements. So for each column j, we need to sum all M elements in that column. But if we process columns, each block might handle a range of columns, but that's not straightforward here.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of rows. Since each column has M elements, and each block can process a certain number of rows. Wait, no. Let me think again. The sum is over the last dimension (columns), so for each column j, sum over i from 0 to M-1. So for each column j, we need to sum all the elements in that column. So the kernel needs to process each column, and for each column, sum all the elements in that column.

But how to structure the blocks. Let me think about how to structure the kernel. Each thread can handle a single column. But if we have N columns, then each thread can handle one column. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each block handles a range of columns. But since each column has M elements, the number of threads per block would need to be sufficient to process all elements in a column.

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the column. Wait, but that would require a lot of threads. Let me think about the problem again.

The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N]. The output is a 1D tensor of shape [M], where output[i] is the sum of input[i, 0], input[i, 1], ..., input[i, N-1]. Wait, no. Wait, the sum is along the last dimension. So for each row i, the sum is over the columns. Wait, no. Wait, the last dimension is N. So the sum is over the N dimension. So for each row i, the sum is over the columns j. So the output is a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the sum of the elements in row i across all columns j.

Wait, no. Wait, the sum reduction along the last dimension (N) would mean that for each element in the first dimension (M), we sum across the N elements. So for example, if the input is [M, N], the output is [M], where output[i] is sum_{j=0}^{N-1} input[i, j]. So each row is summed across columns.

So the kernel needs to compute for each row i, the sum of all elements in that row. So the output is a 1D tensor of size M, with each element being the sum of the row i.

So how to structure the kernel. Each thread can process a single row, and sum all elements in that row. But that would require each thread to process N elements (the columns of the row). But if the row has N elements, and each thread can process a single element, then for each row, we need N threads. But that's not efficient. Alternatively, maybe each block processes a row, and the threads within the block process the elements of that row.

So the approach would be: for each row i, the threads in the block process the elements of that row, adding them up. Then, the block writes the sum to the output.

But how to structure this. Let's think about the kernel parameters. The kernel needs to take the input tensor, the output tensor, M, N. Then, each thread is responsible for a row i, and computes the sum of that row.

But how to handle the threads. Let's say we have a block size of, say,

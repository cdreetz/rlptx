Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations required. The task is to compute the mean of each row in the 2D tensor. So for each row (each M element), I need to sum all the elements in that row and then divide by N. But since Triton is a GPU programming language, I need to structure this in a way that's efficient on the GPU.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

Now, considering the block sizes and memory access patterns. Triton kernels are typically structured with threads grouped into blocks. For this problem, each block can handle a portion of the rows. Since each row has N elements, I need to process each row's elements. The block size should be chosen such that it's efficient for the GPU. A common approach is to use a block size that's a power of two, like 256. But I need to make sure that each thread in the block can process a part of the row.

Wait, but for each row, we need to sum N elements. If each thread handles one element, then each thread would add its element to a shared sum. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe using a warp-based approach where each warp processes a few elements. But for simplicity, perhaps using a block size that can handle the elements in the row.

Wait, but the rows are of length N. So for each row, we need to process N elements. Let me think about how to structure the threads. Each thread could be responsible for a single element in the row. But if the block size is, say, 256, then each block can handle 256 elements. However, since each row has N elements, the number of blocks needed would be M / (number of elements per block). Wait, no. Each block can process one row. Wait, maybe each block is responsible for a single row. But that might not be efficient if N is large. Alternatively, each block can process multiple rows, but that depends on the data.

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in a row. Then, for each row, each thread adds its element to a shared sum. But how to organize that. Let me think: for each row, the threads in the block can process the elements of that row. So the block is responsible for a single row. Then, each thread in the block would process a single element of that row. But then, the number of threads per block would be N. But if N is large, that could be a problem. However, Triton allows for dynamic block sizes, but maybe for this problem, the block size can be set to N. But that's not feasible if N is large, since the block size can't be larger than 1024. So perhaps, the block size is set to a fixed value, like 256, and then each block handles a portion of the row.

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. Then, for each row, the threads in the block would process the elements. But how to handle that. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The kernel would take the input tensor, and output tensor. The kernel's index would be the row index. So for each row, the threads in the block would process the elements of that row.

Wait, but the kernel is written in Triton, which is a high-level GPU programming language. So the kernel would be written with a loop over the rows, and then for each row, process the elements.

So the steps would be:

1. For each row in the input tensor (each row is of length N), compute the sum of the elements in that row.
2. Divide the sum by N to get the mean.
3. Store the result in the output tensor.

So the kernel would need to iterate over each row, and for each row, iterate over each element in the row, sum them, then divide by N.

But how to structure this in Triton. The kernel is written with a loop over the rows, and then a loop over the elements in the row. However, Triton's loops are written with the @triton.jit decorator, and the kernel is written with a loop over the rows, and then a loop over the elements in the row.

But the problem is that for each row, the number of elements is N, which could be large. So the kernel needs to handle that.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows. Let's say that the kernel is written

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to compute the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. So for each row (each M element), I need to sum all the elements in that row and then divide by N. But since Triton is a GPU kernel, I need to handle this in a way that's efficient on the GPU.

Input and output shapes: The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

Memory layout: The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. The output will be a 1D array where each element corresponds to a row's mean.

Optimal block sizes: For a 2D tensor, each block can process a row. Since each row has N elements, the block size should be chosen such that each thread handles a single element in the row. But maybe I can have each thread process one element in the row. Wait, but if I have N elements per row, and each thread handles one element, then the number of threads per block would be N. However, if N is large, this could be inefficient. Alternatively, maybe we can process multiple elements per thread, but that depends on how the data is laid out.

Wait, the problem is to compute the sum of each row. So for each row, sum all N elements. Then divide by N. So for each row, we need to sum N elements. So the kernel should process each row, and for each row, sum all elements.

So the kernel should iterate over each row (M rows), and for each row, iterate over each element (N elements) and sum them. Then divide by N.

But how to structure this in Triton. Triton kernels are written with a grid and a block structure. Let's think about the grid. The grid will have M blocks, each block handling one row. Each block will process all N elements in that row.

But for each row, the threads in the block need to process all N elements. So each block will have N threads, each handling one element in the row. But that's not efficient if N is large. Alternatively, maybe we can have a block size that is a multiple of N, but that depends on the specific N.

Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread process a single element in the row, and the block size is N. But for large N, this could be a problem. However, Triton's block size can be adjusted. Let's think about the block size as N, but that might not be feasible if N is large. Alternatively, maybe the block size is set to a fixed value, like 256, and we use a loop over the elements in the row.

Wait, but the kernel needs to process all elements in the row. So perhaps for each row, the threads in the block process the elements in the row. For example, if the block size is 256, then each block can process up to 256 elements in the row. But that would require that N is a multiple of 256, which might not be the case. So perhaps using a dynamic approach where each thread processes one element in the row.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread handles one element in the row, and the block processes all elements in the row. So for each row, the block has N threads, each processing one element. But that would require that the block size is N. However, if N is large, this could lead to a lot of threads per block, which might not be efficient. But Triton allows for dynamic block sizes, so maybe that's acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel can be structured with a block size of 256, and each thread processes a certain number of elements in the row. But that would require that the threads in the block work together to sum the elements. However, that might complicate the code.

Let me think about the steps again. For each row i, we need to compute the sum of elements from column 0 to N-1. Then divide by N. So for each row, the sum is the sum of all elements in that row.

So the kernel will have to:

1. Iterate over each row (i) in the input tensor.
2. For each row, iterate over each column (j) in the row.
3. Sum all the elements in the row.
4. Divide the sum by N to get the mean.

But how to implement this in Triton.

The kernel will have a grid of M blocks, each block handling one row. Each block will have multiple threads, each processing

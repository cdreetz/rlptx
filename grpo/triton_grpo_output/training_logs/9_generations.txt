Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is to sum over the columns (since the last dimension is N). So for each row in the tensor, I need to sum all the elements in that row. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding row.

Now, considering Triton kernels, I need to think about how to structure the kernel. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA, but with more high-level abstractions. The key is to use the triton library's features to efficiently compute the sum.

Let me break down the steps:

1. **GPU Operations**: The main operation is summing elements along the last dimension. Each thread should handle a specific row and accumulate the sum of its elements.

2. **Input/Output Shapes**: The input tensor is [M, N], and the output is [M]. Each element in the output is the sum of the corresponding row in the input.

3. **Block Sizes and Memory Access**: I need to decide on the block size. Since each thread can handle one row, the number of threads per block should be such that each thread processes a row. However, since the number of rows (M) can be large, I need to make sure that the block size is chosen optimally. Typically, using a block size of 256 is common, but I need to adjust based on the problem.

Wait, but if each thread is responsible for a single row, then the number of threads per block would be the number of rows per block. However, since the rows are processed in parallel, each thread can process a row. So, for each row, the thread would iterate over the columns (N elements) and sum them.

But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can process multiple elements in a row per thread. Wait, but the sum is along the last dimension, so for each row, we need to sum all N elements. So each thread would need to process a row, and sum all the elements in that row.

But how to do that efficiently? Let's think about the memory layout. The input tensor is 2D, so each row is contiguous in memory. So for a given row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j for j from 0 to N-1.

So, each thread can be assigned a row index i, and then iterate over the columns j from 0 to N-1, adding the value at (i, j) to the sum.

But if I have a block size of, say, 256, then each block can handle 256 rows. But if M is larger than the number of threads, then multiple blocks are needed. However, if the number of rows is large, then each thread would process a row, and the number of threads per block would be the number of rows per block.

But how to structure the kernel? Let me think about the parameters. The kernel needs to take the input tensor, the output tensor, and the dimensions M and N.

In Triton, the kernel is written with a @triton.jit decorator, and the kernel function is defined with parameters. The kernel will have to loop over the rows and columns.

But perhaps a better approach is to have each thread handle a single row. So, for each row i, the thread will sum all the elements in that row.

But how to handle the threads? Let's think about the number of threads. The total number of rows is M. So, the number of threads needed is M. Each thread is responsible for one row. So, the kernel will have to process M threads. However, in Triton, the kernel is launched with a certain number of blocks and threads per block. So, the kernel needs to be written in a way that each thread is assigned a row index.

Wait, but how to do that? The kernel function would have a loop over the rows, and each thread would process one row. But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows, and each thread is assigned a row index.

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured with a loop over the rows, and each thread is responsible for a specific row. For example:

def kernel(input, output, M, N):
    pid = tl.program_id(axis=0)
    i = pid
    if i >= M:
        return
    sum_val = 0.0
    for j in range(N):
        val = tl.load(input + i*N + j)
        sum_val += val
    tl.store(output + i, sum_val)

But this is a simplified version. However, in Triton, the loops are written with triton's loop

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum each column of the tensor. So for each column (which is along the N dimension), we need to add up all the elements in that column. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [N], where each element is the sum of the corresponding column.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The input has M rows and N columns. The output will have N elements, each being the sum of a column. So for each column index j in 0 to N-1, sum all elements in row i, column j for i from 0 to M-1.

Now, considering the Triton kernel structure. Triton kernels are written with a grid and a block. Each thread block will handle a portion of the data. Since we're summing columns, each thread block should process a single column. But how to divide the work?

Wait, maybe each thread block handles a single column. But how many threads per block? Let's think about the block size. If each block processes one column, then the number of blocks would be N. But if N is large, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each block processes multiple columns, but that could complicate things. Wait, no. Since each column is independent, maybe each thread block can handle a single column. But then, for each column, we need to sum all the elements in that column. So each thread in the block would process a row in that column. But how to organize that.

Alternatively, maybe each thread block is responsible for a single column. Let's say each block processes one column. Then, each thread in the block would process a row in that column. But that would require that each block has enough threads to process all the rows in the column. But if the number of rows M is large, then the block size needs to be at least M. But that's not efficient, since Triton's default block size is 256. So perhaps we need to split the columns into blocks, but each block handles a single column. Wait, maybe that's not the best approach.

Alternatively, think of the problem as each thread block processing a single column. The number of threads per block would be M, but that's not feasible if M is large. So maybe we need to split the columns into blocks, but each block handles a single column. Wait, but that's not possible if the number of columns N is large. So perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread block processes a single column, and each thread in the block processes a single row in that column. But then, the number of threads per block would be M, but that's not possible if M is large. So maybe the block size is set to a fixed number, say 256, and each block processes a single column, but then the threads in the block would process multiple rows in that column. Wait, but that would require that each thread in the block is responsible for a single row in the column. But if the number of rows M is larger than the block size, then multiple threads per block would be needed. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread block processes a single column. The number of threads per block is determined by the number of rows M. But that's not feasible if M is large. So maybe the block size is set to a fixed value, and each block processes a single column. But then, for each column, the threads in the block would process a subset of the rows. But that would require that each thread in the block is responsible for a single row. However, if the number of rows M is larger than the block size, then multiple blocks would be needed for each column. But that's not efficient.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread block processes a single column, and the number of threads per block is equal to the number of rows in that column. But that's not possible because the number of rows is M, which could be large. So perhaps the kernel is designed with a fixed block size, and each block handles a single column. Then, each thread in the block processes a single row in that column. But if the number of rows M is larger than the block size, then multiple threads per block would be needed. Wait, but that's not possible. So maybe the block size is set to 256, and each block processes a single column, and each thread in the block processes a single row in that column. But if M is larger than 256, then each block would have to process multiple rows. Wait

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. Matrix multiplication involves computing the dot product of rows from the first matrix and columns from the second matrix. So for each element in the resulting matrix of shape [M, N], I need to compute the sum over K elements of (A[i][k] * B[k][j]).

Now, the input and output tensors. The first tensor A is MxK, the second B is KxN. The output C will be MxN. Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

Next, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels use blocks with a certain size. For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that allows efficient computation. Let's say each block handles a certain number of rows and columns. But since K can be large, maybe we need to split the problem into smaller chunks. Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is usually written with a loop over the elements, so maybe the block size is set to something like 256, and each thread handles a particular element in the output matrix.

Wait, but for matrix multiplication, the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element of the output. However, that's not very efficient because it leads to a lot of memory accesses. So maybe a better approach is to have each block compute a block of elements, but that's more complex. Alternatively, using a block size that allows for efficient memory access patterns.

Alternatively, considering that each thread computes a single element of C, but with proper memory access patterns. Let's think about how to structure this.

The key is to have each thread compute a single element of C[i][j], which requires loading A[i][k] and B[k][j] for all k, then summing their products. But for this, each thread would need to iterate over k, which is the dimension that's being summed over.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. So perhaps the kernel is structured with a loop over i (rows of A), j (columns of B), and k (the dimension being summed over). But that would be a triple loop, which might not be efficient. Alternatively, using a block size that allows for a certain number of elements to be processed in parallel.

Wait, maybe the standard approach for Triton matrix multiplication is to have each thread compute a single element of C. So for each thread, we have i and j, and then compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. But how to structure this in Triton.

Alternatively, using a block size that allows for a certain number of elements in the K dimension. For example, if the block size is 32, then each block can process 32 elements in the K dimension. But that might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, the standard approach is to use a block size that allows for a certain number of rows and columns. For example, in the case of matrix multiplication, each block can handle a certain number of rows and columns, and each thread computes a certain number of elements. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is written with a loop over the K dimension, and each thread computes a single element of C. Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. So for A, each row is contiguous in memory. Similarly for B.

So for a given i and j, the elements A[i][k] are stored in A[i*stride_A + k], and B[k][j] are stored in B[k*stride_B + j]. But in Triton, the tensors are passed as pointers, and the strides are handled via the kernel's parameters.

So, the kernel needs to compute for each i and j, the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But how to structure this in Triton. The kernel is written with a loop over the elements. Let's think about the parameters. The kernel will take the pointers to A, B, and C, along with the dimensions M, K, N. Then, for each i and j, compute the sum over k.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. So perhaps the kernel is structured

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by understanding what's required here.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first matrix is MxK, the second is KxN, so the result should be MxN. Each element in the output is the sum of the product of elements from the first row and second column, for each k in 0 to K-1.

Now, thinking about how to implement this in Triton. Triton is a high-performance GPU programming language, so I need to structure the kernel efficiently. The key is to use shared memory to avoid redundant memory accesses and to optimize for coalesced memory access.

Let me recall the steps for matrix multiplication in Triton. Typically, each thread block handles a block of rows from the first matrix and a block of columns from the second matrix. But since the matrices are MxK and KxN, the block size needs to be chosen such that each thread can handle a part of the computation.

Wait, the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to split the matrices into blocks. For example, each thread block handles a block of K elements from the first matrix and a block of N elements from the second matrix. But since the first matrix is MxK and the second is KxN, maybe the block size should be such that each thread computes a single element of the output.

Alternatively, maybe each thread block is responsible for computing a row of the output matrix. Let me think: the first matrix is M rows, each of K elements. The second matrix is K rows, each of N elements. The output is M rows, each of N elements. So for each output element (i, j), it's the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

In Triton, each thread can compute one element of the output. But that might not be efficient because each thread would have to load K elements from A and B, which could be slow. So perhaps a better approach is to use shared memory to store a block of rows from A and columns from B, so that each thread can compute a part of the sum.

Wait, the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to use a block size that allows each thread to compute a part of the sum. For example, if the block size is 32, each thread can handle a certain number of elements. But for the case of MxK and KxN, the block size should be such that each thread can process a certain number of elements in the K dimension.

Let me think about the memory layout. The first matrix is [M, K], so each row is K elements. The second matrix is [K, N], each row is N elements. The output is [M, N], each row is N elements.

In Triton, the kernel will have to process each element of the output. So, for each element (i, j), the thread will compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. But if we have K elements, and each thread is responsible for one element, then each thread would have to load K elements from A and B, which could be slow. So, to optimize, we can use shared memory to store a block of K elements from A and a block of K elements from B, but that might not be the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a block size that allows each thread to compute a part of the sum. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread can handle a certain number of elements in the K dimension. Wait, but the K dimension is the same for both matrices. So, maybe each thread block is responsible for a certain number of rows in A and columns in B.

Wait, maybe I should structure the kernel such that each thread block handles a block of K elements from A and a block of N elements from B. But since the second matrix is KxN, each row is N elements. So, for each row in A (which is K elements), and each column in B (which is N elements), the product is computed.

Alternatively, the standard approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to compute a part of the sum. For example, each thread block handles a block of K elements from A and a block of N elements from B. But that's not possible because K and N can be different. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

In the case of matrix multiplication, the standard approach is to split the matrices into blocks. For example, each thread block handles a block of K elements from A and a block of N elements from B. However, the number of elements in the K dimension for A is K, and for B it's K as well. So, perhaps each thread block is responsible for a block

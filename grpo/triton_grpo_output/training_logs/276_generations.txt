Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The user specified using tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through how to approach this.

First, I remember that matrix multiplication involves computing each element of the resulting matrix as the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix. But with large matrices, doing this directly would be inefficient. So, tile-based computation is a way to optimize by breaking the matrices into smaller tiles that can be stored in shared memory, which is faster than global memory.

The input tensors are A (M x K) and B (K x N). The output is C (M x N), where each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. 

For shared memory, I need to divide the matrices into tiles. Let's say each tile is of size BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K for matrix A and BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N for matrix B. Wait, but the tiles need to fit into shared memory. The block size should be chosen such that the tiles can be stored in shared memory. Typically, for matrix multiplication, the block size is chosen based on the number of elements that can fit in shared memory. But since the user didn't specify the block size, I'll have to choose a common one, like 32 or 64, but maybe 32 is more common for shared memory.

Wait, the standard approach for Triton matrix multiplication is to use a block size that allows for efficient computation. Let me recall. For example, a common block size is 32, but sometimes 64 is used. Let me think about the memory layout. 

In Triton, each thread handles a block of elements. For matrix multiplication, each thread can compute a portion of the result. The key is to split the matrices into tiles. So, for matrix A, each thread will handle a tile of size BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K, and for matrix B, a tile of size BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N. But how to arrange this?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the threads. Each thread will compute a certain part of the result. Let me think about the indices. For each thread, we can compute a block of the output matrix. The thread index can be used to determine which part of the matrix it's responsible for.

Alternatively, the standard approach for Triton matrix multiplication is to have each thread compute a single element of the result. But that's not efficient. Instead, using a tile-based approach where each thread handles a block of elements. However, I'm not sure about the exact structure here.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to use a block size that allows for multiple elements to be computed in parallel. Let me recall the standard Triton matrix multiplication code. For example, the kernel might look like this:

Each thread is responsible for computing a certain part of the result. The kernel is divided into blocks, and each block processes a tile of the matrix. The shared memory is used to store the tiles of A and B.

So, for matrix A (M x K) and B (K x N), the shared memory will store tiles of A and B. The tile size for A is (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K), and for B it's (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N). The result is stored in a shared memory tile as well, or computed in the warp.

Wait, but in the standard approach, the shared memory is used to store the tiles of A and B. The threads in the block process the tiles. Let me think about the steps:

1. The kernel is divided into blocks, each block processing a tile of the matrices. For each block, the threads load the corresponding tiles of A and B into shared memory.

2. Then, the threads compute the dot product between the tiles of A and B, and accumulate the result into the output matrix.

But how to structure the threads in the block? Each thread might be responsible for a certain element in the result. Alternatively, each thread could be responsible for a certain block of elements.

Alternatively, the standard approach for Triton matrix multiplication uses a block size of 32, where each thread computes a single element of the result. But that's not efficient. Wait, no, that's not right. The standard approach is to have each thread compute a block of elements, but that's more complex.

Alternatively, the kernel might be structured such that each thread is responsible for a certain row in A and column in B. Wait, but that's the same as the standard matrix multiplication. However, with shared memory, we can load the tiles into shared memory and compute the dot product.

So, for the kernel, the steps would be:

- For each block of the matrix, compute the tiles of A and B that fit into shared memory.

- Load the tiles into shared memory.

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in Triton.

First, the matrices are A (MxK) and B (KxN). The result C will be MxN. Each element C[i,j] is the sum of A[i,k] * B[k,j] for k from 0 to K-1.

In Triton, I need to handle this with shared memory to optimize memory access. The idea is to tile the matrices into blocks that fit into shared memory. Let's think about the block size. Common choices are 32 or 64, but maybe 32 is better for smaller matrices. Wait, the problem says tile-based, so I need to define a block size that allows for efficient computation.

Let me think about the steps:

1. For each block of A and B, load them into shared memory.
2. Compute the dot product of the tiles.
3. Store the result in the output matrix.

But how to structure the threads? Each thread might handle a specific element of C. Wait, but in matrix multiplication, each thread might compute a single element, but that's not efficient. Alternatively, each thread could compute a block of elements. But maybe the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element, but with shared memory for the tiles.

Wait, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for computing a single element of C. However, with shared memory, we can load the relevant rows of A and columns of B into shared memory, then compute the dot product.

But for that, the threads need to be arranged in a way that each thread handles a specific element. However, with tile-based computation, maybe each thread block handles a tile of A and B.

Alternatively, the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element, but with shared memory for the tiles. Let me think about the steps again.

Let me recall the standard Triton matrix multiplication kernel. The kernel typically has:

- Each thread computes a single element of C.
- The thread index is (i, j) where i is the row in C and j is the column in C.
- For each element C[i,j], the thread computes the sum over k of A[i,k] * B[k,j].

But to optimize, we can load the row of A into shared memory and the column of B into shared memory, then compute the dot product. However, that would require each thread to load a row of A and a column of B, which might not be efficient.

Alternatively, using tile-based computation, each thread block handles a block of A and B. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread block handles a 32x32 tile of A and B. Then, the threads in the block compute the dot product of the tiles.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again. The problem says to use tile-based computation with shared memory, so I need to structure the kernel to use shared memory for tiles.

Let me outline the steps:

1. The kernel is designed to compute C = A * B, where A is MxK and B is KxN.

2. The kernel is divided into blocks. Each block processes a tile of A and B. The tile size is determined by the block size. Let's say each tile is of size (block_size, block_size). So for A, each tile is block_size rows by block_size columns, and for B, each tile is block_size rows by block_size columns.

But wait, A is MxK, B is KxN. So the tiles for A would be of size (block_size, block_size), and for B, (block_size, block_size). Then, the dot product between the tiles would be computed.

But how to align the tiles? For example, the tile of A would be a block of rows and columns, and the tile of B would be a block of rows and columns. Then, the dot product between the tiles would be computed.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to think in terms of how the threads are arranged. For example, each thread block handles a block of rows in A and columns in B. Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element of C, but with shared memory for the tiles.

Alternatively, the kernel is structured such that each thread block handles a block of rows in A and columns in B. For example, each thread block processes a block of A's rows and B's columns, then computes the dot product.

But maybe I should refer to standard Triton matrix multiplication examples. From what I remember, in Triton, the matrix multiplication kernel usually has:

- Each thread computes a single element of C.
- The thread

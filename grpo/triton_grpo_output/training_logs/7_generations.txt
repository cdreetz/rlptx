Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works. The result should be a tensor of shape [M, N], where each element is the dot product of the corresponding row from the first matrix and column from the second matrix.

First, I need to figure out the GPU operations required. Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for parallelism, so I should structure the kernel to handle each element of the output matrix. Each thread will compute one element of the result.

The input tensors are A (MxK) and B (KxN). The output C (MxN) is computed as C[i][j] = sum over k (A[i][k] * B[k][j]).

Now, considering the memory layout. The input tensors are likely stored in row-major order, which is the default in most frameworks. So for A, each row is contiguous in memory, and similarly for B. The output C will also be stored in row-major order.

Next, block sizes and memory access patterns. Triton uses a grid and block structure. For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to handle a small portion of the matrices. A typical choice is to use a block size of 32, but I need to check if that's optimal here. Alternatively, maybe 128? Wait, the exact block size depends on the problem. Let me think: each thread will compute one element of C. So for each thread, it needs to access K elements from A and B. But if K is large, that could be a problem. However, in Triton, the kernel can be optimized by using shared memory to store the relevant parts of A and B, so that each thread can access them efficiently.

Wait, the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to use shared memory. Each threadblock loads a portion of A and B into shared memory, then computes the dot product. But in this case, since the matrices are [M,K] and [K,N], the threads would need to process each element of C. However, if the block size is small, maybe 32, then each threadblock can handle a certain number of rows in A and columns in B. Hmm, perhaps I should structure the kernel such that each threadblock handles a block of rows in A and a block of columns in B, and then compute the dot product for each element in C.

Alternatively, maybe each thread computes one element of C. Let me think: for each element C[i][j], the thread would need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. If each thread is responsible for one element, then each thread would need to iterate over k, but that could be inefficient if K is large. However, if K is large, then using shared memory to store A and B in a way that allows for efficient access is necessary.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to split the matrices into blocks. For example, each threadblock handles a block of rows in A and a block of columns in B. Then, each thread in the block computes a part of the dot product. But I need to make sure that the block size is chosen such that the threads can efficiently access the shared memory.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed such that each threadblock handles a block of rows in A and a block of columns in B, and each thread in the block computes a single element of C. But I need to think about the memory layout and how to access the elements.

Let me outline the steps:

1. The kernel will be launched with grid dimensions that cover all the rows of A (M) and columns of B (N). But since each threadblock can handle multiple rows and columns, maybe the grid is (M // BLOCK_SIZE, N // BLOCK_SIZE), but I need to adjust for the actual dimensions.

Wait, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each threadblock is responsible for computing a block of rows in A and a block of columns in B. For example, if the block size is 32, then each threadblock handles 32 rows of A and 32 columns of B. Then, each thread in the block would compute one element of C. However, this might not be efficient if the block size is too small. Alternatively, the block size could be larger, but I need to find a balance between the number of threads and the memory access patterns.

Alternatively, the kernel could be structured to have each thread compute one element of C, but that would require each thread to iterate over K elements, which could be slow if K is large. Therefore, using shared memory to store a portion of A and B would be better.

Wait, in the standard matrix multiplication approach, each threadblock loads a block of A (say

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by understanding what's required here.

First, the problem is to compute the product of two matrices: A (M x K) and B (K x N), resulting in a matrix C (M x N). Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. 

So, the kernel needs to handle this computation efficiently on the GPU using Triton. Let me think about the steps involved.

The first thing is to figure out the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order, which is the default for most GPU frameworks. So, for A, each row is contiguous in memory, and similarly for B. The output tensor C will also be stored in row-major order.

Now, considering the Triton kernel structure. Triton kernels are written with a loop over the elements, and each thread handles a specific element. But for matrix multiplication, we need to consider how to partition the work among threads. Typically, for matrix multiplication, we can use a block size that allows each thread to compute a single element of the result. However, for efficiency, it's better to have each thread compute multiple elements, but that depends on the problem. Wait, but in this case, since the problem is M x K multiplied by K x N, the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element of the result. However, that might not be efficient for large K. Alternatively, we can use a block size that allows each thread to compute multiple elements, but that's more complex. 

Wait, but for a standard matrix multiplication, each thread computes one element of the result. So, for each element C[i][j], the thread would compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. However, for large K, this could be slow. So, perhaps using a block size that allows for more efficient memory access. 

But the standard approach in Triton for matrix multiplication is to use a block size that allows each thread to compute a single element, but with proper memory access patterns. Let me think about the memory access. For each element C[i][j], the thread would need to access A[i][k] and B[k][j] for all k. 

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. So, the kernel would have a loop over the rows of A (i), and for each i, a loop over the columns of B (j). Then, for each i and j, the thread would compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. 

But how to structure this in Triton. The kernel would have a loop over the rows of A (i) and columns of B (j), and for each i and j, compute the sum over k. However, the problem is that for each i and j, the thread would need to iterate over k from 0 to K-1. 

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. So, perhaps the kernel would have a loop over i, then a loop over j, and then a loop over k. But that would be O(M*N*K) operations, which is not efficient. However, for a Triton kernel, the loops are typically written in a way that each thread handles a single element. 

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for computing a single element of C. So, for each thread, the thread index (thread_id) would correspond to a particular (i, j) pair. But how to map the thread index to (i, j)? 

Wait, in the standard matrix multiplication, each thread is responsible for computing one element of C. So, the thread index can be mapped as follows: for a block size of, say, 32, each block handles a certain range of i and j. But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements, and each thread is responsible for a single element. 

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured with a loop over i, then a loop over j, and then a loop over k. But that would be a triple loop, which is not efficient. So, perhaps the kernel is written with a loop over i, then a loop over j, and for each i and j, the thread computes the sum over k. However, this would be a triple loop, which is not feasible for large K. 

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. So, for each element in the output matrix C, the thread computes it. So, the kernel would have a loop over i and j, and for each i and j, compute the sum over k.

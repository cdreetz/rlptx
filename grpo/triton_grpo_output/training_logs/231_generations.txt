Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the maximum value in that row). So for each row (each row is of length N), we need to compute the max.

So the input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the max of the corresponding row.

Now, considering how to implement this in Triton. Triton kernels are written in a way that's similar to CUDA kernels, with threads processing elements in a grid. The key is to figure out how to partition the work across threads and how to efficiently access the memory.

First, I need to determine the grid and block sizes. Since each row is processed independently, each block can handle one row. But how many threads per block? Let's think about the number of elements per row (N). For each row, we need to find the max of N elements. So, the number of threads per block should be such that each thread can handle a portion of the elements in the row. But since N can vary, we need to choose a block size that's a power of two, maybe 256, which is a common choice for Triton.

But wait, in Triton, the block size is determined by the number of threads per block. So if each block processes one row, then the number of threads per block would be the number of elements in the row (N). But if N is not a power of two, that could be a problem. However, in Triton, the kernel can be written to handle any N by using a loop that iterates through each element in the row. Alternatively, maybe we can use a block size that's a power of two, and handle the remaining elements with a mask.

Alternatively, perhaps we can have each thread process a single element in the row, and then each thread compares with the current max. But that might not be efficient. Let me think.

Another approach is to have each thread handle a group of elements. For example, if the block size is 256, then each thread can process a chunk of elements. But for max reduction, it's more efficient to have each thread process a single element and compare with others.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, the max reduction can be done with a reduction. So, the standard approach for max reduction is to have each thread take a portion of the elements, compare, and then reduce across the block.

So for each row, the block will process all N elements. Let's think about the block size. Let's say we have a block size of 256. Then, for each row, the threads will process elements in the row. The number of threads per block is determined by the number of elements in the row. However, since N can be arbitrary, we need to handle that.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is written such that each thread handles a single element in the row, and then the block reduces across all threads to find the max. But that would require that the number of threads per block is equal to N. However, if N is larger than the block size, this would not work. So, perhaps we need to use a dynamic block size.

Wait, but in Triton, the block size is fixed for a given kernel. So, the kernel must be written in a way that works for any N. Therefore, perhaps the kernel is written with a block size that's a power of two, and the remaining elements are handled with a mask.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is written to process each row, and for each row, the threads in the block process elements in that row. For example, for a row of N elements, the block size is 256, and each thread processes a certain number of elements. But this might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured as follows: each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. Then, the block reduces across all threads to find the max. However, if the number of elements in the row (N) is larger than the number of threads in the block, then the block will have more threads than needed. But since the kernel is written for a given N, maybe we can use a loop that iterates over the elements in the row.

Wait, maybe the kernel is written for each row. So, the grid is determined by the number of rows (M), and each block processes one row. Then, within each block, the threads process the elements of that row.

So, for each row, the block has a certain number of threads. Let's say the block size is

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the maximum value). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the max of N elements.

Now, considering how Triton works, I need to structure the kernel to process this efficiently. Let's think about the input and output. The input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the max of the corresponding row.

Next, I need to decide on the block size. Triton kernels typically use a block size that's a power of two, like 256. But for a reduction operation, the block size might need to be adjusted based on the number of elements to reduce. However, since each row has N elements, and we need to find the max, maybe the block size should be set to process N elements per block. Wait, but N could be large, so perhaps using a warp-based approach where each thread processes a part of the row.

Alternatively, for each row, we can have threads that compute the max. But since each row is independent, maybe each thread can handle a single element, but that's not efficient. Wait, no. For a max reduction, we need to compare elements. So perhaps for each row, we can have threads that compute the max in a way that's efficient.

Wait, the standard approach for a max reduction in Triton is to have each thread process a portion of the data, and then perform a reduction across the threads. But in this case, since each row is independent, maybe we can process each row in parallel.

Let me think about the steps:

1. For each row (i.e., each M element), we need to compute the max of N elements.
2. The kernel should process each row in parallel. So, each block can handle one row. But how many threads per block? If the block size is, say, 256, then each block can process one row, and the threads in the block work together to compute the max of that row.

Wait, but if the row has N elements, then each thread in the block would process a portion of the row. For example, if N is 1024, then a block with 256 threads could process 4 elements each, but that's not efficient. Alternatively, maybe the block size is chosen such that each thread handles one element, but that would be inefficient for large N. However, since the max reduction is a simple operation, maybe each thread can take responsibility for a single element and then compare with others.

Alternatively, the standard approach for max reduction in Triton is to have each thread handle a portion of the data, and then perform a reduction. For example, in a 1D reduction, each thread takes a chunk of data, and then the threads compare their results. But in this case, since the data is 2D, and we need to process each row, perhaps each block is responsible for a single row, and the threads in the block perform the reduction on that row.

So, for each row, the block will process all N elements in that row. The block size would be determined by the number of elements per row. But since N can be arbitrary, perhaps we need to use a dynamic approach.

Alternatively, we can use a block size that is a power of two, and for each row, the threads in the block process elements in that row. For example, if the block size is 256, then each thread in the block handles a portion of the row. But how to handle when N is not a multiple of the block size?

But perhaps the key is to use the standard reduction approach. Let me think of the steps for a single row.

For a single row of N elements, the max can be computed by having each thread in the block take responsibility for a portion of the elements. For example, if there are 256 threads in a block, and N is 1024, then each thread can take 4 elements. But that's not efficient for max reduction. Alternatively, each thread can take one element, and then perform a reduction across the threads. But that would require that the number of threads per block is equal to the number of elements in the row, which is not feasible for large N.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written with a certain number of threads per block, and the kernel is launched with a certain number of blocks. So for each row, the kernel needs to process all N elements. So perhaps the kernel is designed such that each block handles one row

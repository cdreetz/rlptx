Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, matrix multiplication between a MxK matrix and a KxN matrix results in a MxN matrix. Each element in the output is the dot product of the corresponding row from the first matrix and column from the second matrix. So, for each element (i, j) in the output, it's the sum over k from 0 to K-1 of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

Now, considering how Triton works, I need to structure the kernel to handle this efficiently. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA, but with more flexibility and performance.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors are stored in row-major order, which is typical for matrices. So, for the first matrix A (M, K), each row is stored contiguously. Similarly for B (K, N), each row is stored contiguously. The output matrix C (M, N) will also be stored in row-major order.

Next, I need to decide on the block size. Triton kernels often use a block size that's a multiple of 32, but for matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that allows for efficient computation of multiple elements in parallel. However, since K can be large, I need to make sure that the block size is optimized for the inner loop (the dot product computation).

Wait, but in matrix multiplication, the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element of the output. However, that's not efficient for large K. So, perhaps a better approach is to have each thread compute multiple elements, but that depends on the problem. Alternatively, using a block size that can handle multiple elements in the inner loop.

Alternatively, maybe using a block size that allows for each thread to compute a single element, but with efficient memory access. Let me think about the memory access patterns.

For each element C[i][j], the thread needs to access A[i][k] and B[k][j] for all k. So, for each thread, the indices would be i (row of A), j (column of B), and k (the loop index). But in Triton, the threads are organized into warps, and each thread has its own index.

Wait, in Triton, the kernel is written with a function that takes the input tensors and the output tensor, and then the kernel is launched with the appropriate dimensions. The kernel needs to compute each element of the output matrix.

So, the kernel will have to iterate over each element of the output matrix. For each element (i, j), compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But how to structure the threads. Let's think about the grid and blocks. For a matrix multiplication, the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element of the output. However, that's not efficient for large K. But given that Triton is a high-level language, perhaps we can use a block size that allows for efficient computation.

Alternatively, maybe using a block size that allows each thread to compute multiple elements. But that's more complex. Let's start with the basic approach.

The kernel will have to iterate over each element of the output matrix. So, the kernel will have to loop over i (rows of A), j (columns of B), and k (the inner loop for the dot product). But in Triton, the kernel is written with a function that is launched with a grid of threads, and each thread computes a single element.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written as a function that is called with the appropriate dimensions. So, for the matrix multiplication, the kernel would be structured as follows:

Each thread computes one element of the output matrix. The thread's index in the grid would be (i, j), and then for each element, the thread computes the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But for that, the kernel would need to have a loop over k. However, for large K, this could be slow. So, perhaps we need to optimize the inner loop.

But given that the user is asking for a Triton kernel, perhaps the standard approach is to use a block size that allows for each thread to compute one element, and then the inner loop is handled with a loop over k.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a function that is called with the appropriate dimensions. So, the kernel would have to have a loop over i, j, and k.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written in a way that each thread has its own index. So, the kernel would be structured as follows:

The kernel is launched with a grid of threads, where each

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by understanding what's required here.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first matrix is MxK, the second is KxN, so the result should be MxN. Each element in the output is the sum of the products of elements from the rows of the first matrix and columns of the second matrix.

Now, thinking about how to implement this in Triton. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA but with more flexibility. The key is to structure the kernel to efficiently use the GPU's parallelism.

Let me break down the steps:

1. **GPU Operations**: The kernel needs to perform element-wise multiplications and accumulate sums. For each element in the output matrix, we need to compute the dot product between the corresponding row of the first matrix and column of the second matrix.

2. **Input/Output Shapes**: The input tensors are A (M, K) and B (K, N). The output tensor C (M, N) will be the result. Each element C[i][j] is sum(A[i][k] * B[k][j] for k in 0..K-1).

3. **Block Sizes and Memory Access**: Triton kernels are divided into blocks. For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to handle a portion of the computation. The optimal block size is often 32 or 64 elements, but this depends on the problem. For this case, maybe using a block size of 32 or 64 threads per block. However, since K can be large, we need to make sure that the threads can process the necessary elements efficiently.

4. **Memory Access Patterns**: The key is to ensure that each thread accesses memory in a coalesced way. For matrix multiplication, each thread typically handles a single element of the output. However, in this case, since the first matrix is MxK and the second is KxN, each thread might need to compute a single element of the output by multiplying elements from A's row and B's column, then summing them up. But with K possibly being large, this could be slow if done naively. So, perhaps using a more optimized approach where each thread block handles a portion of the K dimension.

Wait, but in standard matrix multiplication, each thread computes a single element of the output. However, that's not efficient for large K. So, maybe using a more optimized approach where each thread block handles a block of K elements. Alternatively, using a tiled approach where each thread block processes a small block of K elements, and the threads within the block compute the dot product between the corresponding rows and columns.

But for this problem, since the user hasn't specified any particular optimizations beyond the basic matrix multiplication, maybe I should proceed with the standard approach where each thread computes a single element of the output.

But let's think about the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. So, for A, each row is contiguous in memory, and for B, each column is contiguous. So, for a given thread, if it's computing C[i][j], it needs to access A[i][k] and B[k][j] for all k. But if K is large, this could lead to many memory accesses per thread, which is inefficient.

Alternatively, perhaps using a more optimized approach where each thread block handles a block of K elements. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread block can process 32 elements of K. But this requires that the K dimension is divisible by the block size. However, since the problem doesn't specify any constraints on K, we need to handle it in a way that works for any K.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written in a way that the threads are divided into blocks, and each block processes a certain portion of the problem. So, for matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to compute a single element of the output. However, that's not efficient for large K. So, maybe the better approach is to use a tiled approach where each thread block handles a tile of K elements.

But how to structure this? Let me think. For each element C[i][j], the sum is over k from 0 to K-1 of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, for each i and j, we need to compute this sum. But if K is large, this sum could take many cycles. So, to optimize, we can split the K dimension into chunks, and have each thread compute a chunk of the sum.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the K dimension. So, perhaps

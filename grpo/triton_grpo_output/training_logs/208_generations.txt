Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think through the steps.

First, the operation is matrix multiplication. So, for each element in the resulting matrix (M, N), it's the sum of the products of elements from the first matrix's row and the second matrix's column. The first matrix is MxK, the second is KxN, so the result is MxN.

In Triton, I'll need to handle this with threads. Each thread should compute one element of the result. But how to organize the threads? Maybe each thread handles a specific element (i, j) in the output matrix. But since K can be large, I need to make sure that the threads can efficiently compute the sum over K.

Wait, but in Triton, it's common to use a block size that allows for efficient memory access. Let's think about the memory layout. The input tensors are stored in row-major order, I assume. So for the first matrix A (M, K), each row is stored contiguously. Similarly for B (K, N), each row is contiguous.

But for matrix multiplication, each thread needs to compute the dot product between a row of A and a column of B. However, since K can be large, we need to make sure that the threads can process the K elements efficiently. So maybe we can use a block size that allows for a certain number of elements to be processed per thread.

Let me think about the block size. Let's say each thread is responsible for a specific i (row in A) and j (column in B). For each i and j, the thread needs to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. But if K is large, this could be slow if each thread does it naively. However, with Triton's warp-level parallelism, maybe we can process multiple k's per thread.

Wait, but in the standard matrix multiplication, each thread computes one element. So for each (i, j), the thread would iterate over k from 0 to K-1, multiply A[i][k] and B[k][j], and sum. But if K is large, this would be slow. So maybe we need to optimize this by using a block size that allows for more k's to be processed in parallel.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a block size that allows for each thread to handle a certain number of k's. But I think the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element, and use shared memory to store the intermediate results. However, that might not be feasible here because the problem is to write a kernel that's efficient.

Wait, but the user is asking for a Triton kernel. So, perhaps the kernel is written in a way that each thread computes one element of the result. Let me think about how to structure that.

So, for each thread, we have i (row index in A), j (column index in B), and then compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. But how to handle the indices.

In Triton, the kernel is launched with a grid of threads. So, for the output matrix, each element (i, j) is computed by a single thread. So the grid size would be M * N, but that's probably not efficient. Wait, but for each i and j, we need a thread. So the grid would be M * N threads. But if M and N are large, that's a lot of threads. However, Triton can handle that.

But then, for each thread, how do we compute the sum over k? Let's think about the memory access. For the first matrix A, each row is stored in contiguous memory. So for a given i, the row is A[i][0], A[i][1], ..., A[i][K-1]. Similarly, for B, each column is stored in contiguous memory. For a given j, the column is B[0][j], B[1][j], ..., B[K-1][j].

But in the case of B, since it's stored as K rows of N elements each, the column j is spread across different rows. So for B[k][j], the index in the tensor is k * N + j. Wait, no. If B is stored in row-major order, then B[k][j] is stored at position k * N + j. So, for a given j, the column is spread across all rows of B.

But for a given i and j, the thread needs to iterate over k from 0 to K-1, and for each k, get A[i][k] and B[k][j], multiply them, and sum.

But if K is large, this would be a lot of operations per thread. So to optimize

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by understanding what's required here.

First, matrix multiplication between a MxK matrix and a KxN matrix results in a MxN matrix. So the output tensor will have shape [M, N]. The kernel needs to compute each element of this output by summing the products of corresponding elements from the input matrices.

Now, thinking about how to structure the Triton kernel. Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for GPU parallelism. The key is to use proper memory access patterns and block sizes to maximize throughput.

Let me recall the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton. Typically, each thread block handles a block of the output matrix. The threads within the block are responsible for computing a single element of the output. But since K can be large, we need to optimize the inner loop over K.

Wait, but in the standard approach, each thread block handles a block of the output matrix. For example, if the block size is 32, each thread might handle a single element of the output. However, for better performance, especially with large K, it's better to use a more efficient approach where each thread block processes a block of the output matrix, and the threads within the block handle the computation for that block.

Alternatively, maybe using a tile-based approach where each thread block handles a tile of the output matrix. But I need to think about how to structure the loops.

Let me think about the indices. For each element (i, j) in the output matrix, the value is the sum over k from 0 to K-1 of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, the kernel needs to compute this sum for each (i, j) pair.

In Triton, the kernel will have to loop over the rows of the first matrix (A) and columns of the second matrix (B). But how to structure the threads to compute this efficiently.

The standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element of the output. However, this can be inefficient because each thread would have to load K elements from A and B, which could be slow if K is large. So, perhaps a better approach is to use a block size that allows for more efficient computation.

Wait, maybe I should use a block size that can process multiple elements in parallel. For example, if each thread block handles a block of the output matrix, and each thread in the block handles a single element. But then, for each element, the thread would need to iterate over K elements, which could be slow.

Alternatively, using a more optimized approach where each thread block computes a block of the output matrix, and the threads within the block process multiple elements. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

In the standard Triton matrix multiplication, each thread block is responsible for computing a block of the output matrix. The threads within the block are arranged in a grid that allows for efficient computation. For example, each thread might compute a single element of the output matrix, and the block size is chosen such that each thread can process a single element efficiently.

But for large K, this approach might not be optimal. However, given that the user hasn't specified any particular constraints on K, I think the standard approach is acceptable.

So, the steps are:

1. Determine the block size. Typically, a block size of 32 or 64 is used. Let's go with 32 for this example.

2. The kernel will have to iterate over the rows of A (M) and columns of B (N). For each element (i, j) in the output, compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

3. The kernel needs to handle the indices properly. Each thread will compute one element of the output. The threads are arranged in a grid where each thread is responsible for a single element.

But how to map the thread index to the (i, j) pair. Let's think: the number of threads per block is BLOCK_SIZE. Let's say that each thread is responsible for a single element (i, j). The threads are arranged in a grid where each thread block processes a certain number of rows and columns.

Wait, maybe the kernel is structured as follows: each thread block processes a certain number of rows (say, rows_per_block) and columns (cols_per_block) of the output matrix. Then, each thread in the block is responsible for a single element (i, j) within that block. However, this approach would require that the block size is such that the number of threads per block can handle the rows and columns.

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element (i, j) in the output matrix. The threads are arranged in a grid where each thread block handles a certain

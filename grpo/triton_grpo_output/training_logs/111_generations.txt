Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that subtracts two 1D tensors element-wise. Let's start by understanding the problem. The user wants efficient memory access, so I should think about how to structure the kernel to maximize throughput.

First, the input tensors are 1D, so they're stored in contiguous memory. Each element in the first tensor (A) needs to be subtracted by the corresponding element in the second tensor (B). The output tensor (C) will be the result of A - B.

In Triton, I'll need to handle the kernel in a way that each thread processes a single element. But wait, maybe using a block size that allows for better memory access. Let me think about the block size. Typically, for 1D tensors, a block size of 256 is common, but maybe 128 or 64? Wait, the user said efficient memory access, so maybe using a larger block size to process more elements per thread? Or maybe not. Wait, for element-wise operations, each thread can handle one element. But if the block size is larger, maybe there's more parallelism. Hmm, but for 1D tensors, each thread can process one element, so the block size can be set to 1, but that's not efficient. Wait, no, in Triton, the kernel is divided into warps, and each warp can have multiple threads. So maybe using a block size that allows for multiple threads per warp, but each thread handles one element. Wait, but for 1D tensors, each element is accessed sequentially, so maybe the block size is set to 1, but that's not efficient. Alternatively, maybe using a block size that allows for multiple threads to process elements in a way that reduces memory access latency.

Wait, perhaps the best approach is to have each thread handle one element. So, for each thread, we compute C[i] = A[i] - B[i]. But to do that, each thread needs to read A[i] and B[i], then write to C[i]. However, if the tensors are stored in contiguous memory, then each thread can compute its own index. But for memory access, we need to make sure that the threads are accessing the elements in a way that minimizes bank conflicts and maximizes coalescing.

Wait, but for a 1D tensor, each thread's index is i = tid + blockIdx * blockDim. So, for each thread, we can compute the index as i = tid + blockIdx * blockDim. Wait, no, in Triton, the kernel is launched with a grid of blocks, each block has a certain number of threads. So, for a 1D tensor, the kernel would have each thread process a single element. So, the block size is set to 1, but that's not efficient. Wait, but maybe the block size is set to a larger number, but each thread still processes one element. Wait, but that's not possible. If the block size is larger, like 256, then each thread in the block would process a different element. But that would require that the block size is set to the number of elements per block. But that's not feasible for arbitrary N. So, perhaps the block size is set to 1, and each thread handles one element. However, that's not efficient in terms of memory access, because each thread would have to read from A and B, which are contiguous. So, if the threads are in the same block, they can access the same memory in a coalesced way.

Wait, maybe the block size is set to 256, but each thread is responsible for a single element. So, the kernel would have each thread compute its own index, then read A[i], B[i], subtract, and write to C[i]. But for this, the kernel would need to have each thread's index calculated as i = tid + blockIdx * blockDim. Wait, no. The grid is determined by the number of blocks, and each block has a certain number of threads. So, for a tensor of size N, the number of blocks is ceil(N / blockDim). Each thread in the block would have an index i = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim. So, for example, if blockDim is 256, then each block handles 256 elements. But if N is not a multiple of 256, then the last block would have fewer elements.

But in this case, for each thread, we can compute i = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim. Then, we can load A[i], B[i], subtract, and store to C[i]. However, the problem is that if the tensors are stored in contiguous memory, then each thread's access is sequential, which is coalesced. So, for a 1D tensor, this should be efficient.

But wait, in Triton, the kernel is written in

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that subtracts two 1D tensors element-wise. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is straightforward: for each element in the first tensor, subtract the corresponding element in the second tensor. But since I'm writing a Triton kernel, I need to make sure the memory access is efficient. Triton is a GPU programming language, so I should focus on coalesced memory access and proper thread blocking.

Let me start by considering the input and output tensors. Both are 1D, with shape (N,). The kernel needs to process each element in parallel. So, each thread will handle one element. But wait, maybe using a block size of 1 is possible, but that might not be efficient. However, for simplicity, maybe a block size of 1 is okay here, but I should check if there's a better way. Wait, no, in Triton, threads are grouped into blocks, and each thread can process a single element. So for a 1D tensor, each thread can handle one element. But maybe using a block size of 1 is acceptable here, but I need to make sure that the memory access is coalesced.

Wait, but if each thread is handling one element, then the memory access is sequential. But for a 1D tensor, each element is stored in contiguous memory, so accessing each element in order would be coalesced. So that's good. So each thread would load the i-th element from the first tensor, the i-th element from the second tensor, subtract them, and store the result.

But how to handle the indices? Let's think: the kernel is launched with N elements. Each thread is responsible for a particular index. So for a thread in block 0, it would process index 0, block 1 processes index 1, etc. Wait, but in Triton, threads are in a block, and each thread has a unique index within the block. So if I have a block size of 1, then each thread is responsible for one element. But if the block size is larger, like 256, then each thread would process a different element. Wait, but how to map the thread index to the element index.

Wait, the kernel is supposed to process all elements. So the kernel needs to be launched with a grid size that covers all elements. For example, if N is 1024, then the grid would have 1024 blocks, each with 1 thread. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe the kernel is launched with a grid size of 1, and each block has multiple threads. Wait, no. Let me think again.

In Triton, the kernel is launched with a grid size, and each block has a certain number of threads. For example, if the kernel is written with a block size of 256, then the grid size would be ceil(N / 256). But for each thread in the block, they process a different element. So the thread index within the block is i, and the element index is i + block_id * block_size. Wait, but that would require that the block size is chosen such that the total number of threads is N. So for example, if the block size is 256, then the grid size would be ceil(N / 256). But for each thread in the block, the element index is block_id * block_size + thread_id. However, if N is not a multiple of block_size, then some threads may be out of bounds. So we need to handle that with masking.

So the steps would be:

1. Determine the block size. Let's say we choose a block size of 256. But for this problem, since it's a 1D tensor, maybe a block size of 1 is sufficient. But maybe using a larger block size can lead to better performance, but in this case, since each thread is handling a single element, the block size might not matter much. However, for the sake of efficiency, maybe using a block size of 1 is better. Wait, no. If the block size is 1, then each thread is responsible for one element, and the grid size is N. But for large N, that could be a lot of blocks. But Triton can handle that. However, maybe using a larger block size is better for cache efficiency. But in this case, since the data is stored in contiguous memory, each thread can access the element directly.

So, for each thread, the element index is i = thread_idx. But how to compute that. Let me think. The kernel is launched with a grid of size N, and each block has 1 thread. So the thread index is the same as the element index. So for each thread, the index is i = 0 to N-1.

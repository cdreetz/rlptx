Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the max of the elements in that row). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the maximum of N elements.

Next, input and output shapes. The input tensor is [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the max of the corresponding row.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Since we're dealing with rows, each threadblock should process one row. So, the number of threadblocks should be M. Each threadblock will handle one row. The number of threads per block would depend on how many elements are in each row. For a row of N elements, if we have, say, 32 threads per block, then each thread would handle N/32 elements. But since N can vary, maybe we should use a dynamic approach. Alternatively, we can set the block size to a value that divides N, but since N can be arbitrary, perhaps it's better to use a fixed block size and let the threads process elements in a way that covers the entire row.

Wait, but for max reduction, each thread can take care of a portion of the row. For example, if each threadblock has 32 threads, then each thread would process 32 elements. But if the row has N elements, then the number of threads per block would need to be a divisor of N. But since N can be arbitrary, maybe it's better to use a block size that is a power of two, and let the threads process elements in a way that covers the entire row. Alternatively, maybe we can use a dynamic approach where each threadblock processes a row, and each thread handles a chunk of the row.

Alternatively, for each row, we can have multiple threads working on it. For example, if each threadblock has 32 threads, then each thread can take care of a subset of the row. But how to handle the reduction within the threadblock.

Wait, the standard approach for max reduction in Triton is to have each threadblock process a portion of the data, and then perform a reduction within the block. But in this case, since we're reducing along the last dimension (each row), each threadblock should process one row. Wait, no. Wait, the row is of length N. So, for each row, we need to compute the max of N elements. So, each threadblock can process a row, and within the threadblock, the threads perform the reduction.

So, for each row, the threadblock will process all N elements. The number of threads per block would be determined by the number of elements in the row. But since N can be arbitrary, perhaps we can use a block size that is a power of two, and then use a reduction within the block.

But how to handle this in Triton. Let me think. For example, if each threadblock has 32 threads, then for a row of N elements, each thread would process a chunk of elements. But how to do that.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a block size that is a power of two, and for each row, the threads in the block process elements in a way that they reduce the max. For example, for a row of N elements, the threads in the block would process elements in pairs, then combine their results, and so on, until a single max is found.

But how to map the threads to the elements in the row. Let's say the row is of length N. The number of threads per block is determined by the block size. For example, if the block size is 32, then each threadblock will process 32 elements. But if N is not a multiple of 32, then some elements may be left out. Wait, but that's not acceptable. So perhaps the block size should be chosen such that it can handle any N. Alternatively, we can use a dynamic approach where the number of threads per block is determined by the number of elements in the row. But in Triton, the number of threads per block is fixed when writing the kernel.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a block size that is a power of two, and for each row, the threads in the block process elements in a way that covers the entire row. For example, for a row of N elements, the threads in the block would process elements in a way that they reduce the max. But how to do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each threadblock handles one row, and each thread in the block is responsible for a portion of the row. For example

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the tensor, find the maximum value). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the max of N elements.

Now, considering the GPU operations. Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for parallelism. So I need to figure out how to process each row in parallel. Each thread should handle a row, and within that row, compute the max.

The input tensor is 2D with shape [M, N]. So each row is of length N. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the max of the corresponding row.

Next, the memory layout. The input tensor is stored in row-major order, which is standard. Each thread will process a row. So for each row i, the thread will process elements from column 0 to N-1.

Now, block sizes. Since each thread is handling a row, the block size should be determined by how many elements per row we can process. But since we need to compute the max, each thread needs to read all elements in the row. However, if the number of elements per row (N) is large, we need to make sure that the threads can process them efficiently.

But wait, in Triton, each thread is a warp of 32 threads. So perhaps the block size should be set to 32, but that might not be optimal. Alternatively, maybe the block size is determined by the number of elements per row. Wait, no. For each row, the number of elements is N. So if N is large, each thread can't process all elements. So perhaps we need to have multiple threads per row, each handling a portion of the elements.

But for the max reduction, the standard approach is to have each thread process a subset of the elements, and then combine the results. However, since we're doing a max reduction, the threads can work in a way that each thread takes care of a part of the row, and then the maximum is computed across all threads in the block.

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then they compute the max. But that would require that each thread reads the element and then compares with others. But that's not efficient because for each row, there are N elements, and each thread would need to compare with others. However, for a max reduction, the standard approach is to have each thread process a chunk of elements, and then combine the results.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, if we have a block size of, say, 32, then each block can process 32 elements. But if N is not a multiple of 32, then we need to handle that. But in this case, the problem is that each row is of length N, and we need to find the max of all elements in the row. So for each row, the number of elements is N. So the threads in the block can be responsible for different elements in the row.

But how to structure this. Let me think. For each row, the threads in the block can process elements in a way that they compute the max. For example, if the block has 32 threads, each thread can process a chunk of elements. But for a row of N elements, the number of elements per thread would be N / (number of threads per block). However, if N is not divisible by the number of threads, then some threads might process one more element.

But in this case, since the problem is to compute the max, perhaps the best approach is to have each thread in the block process a portion of the row, and then combine the max values from each thread. But how?

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then they compare their value with the current maximum. However, this would require that each thread has access to the maximum value, which is not straightforward. But in a parallel reduction, we can use a tree-like structure where each thread compares with its neighbor, and then the maximum is propagated up.

But for a row of N elements, the standard way to compute the max is to have each thread process a portion of the elements, and then combine the results. However, for a 2D tensor, each row is processed by a block of threads. So for each row, the threads in the block will process the elements in that row.

So the steps would be:

1. For each row i in the input tensor, compute the max of the elements in that row.

2. The output tensor will have one element per row, which is the max of that row.

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, matrix multiplication between a MxK matrix and a KxN matrix results in a MxN matrix. So the kernel needs to compute each element (i, j) as the sum of the product of elements from the first matrix's row i and the second matrix's column j.

Now, thinking about how to structure this in Triton. Triton kernels are written in a way that's similar to CUDA kernels, using threads per block and blocks per grid. The key is to figure out the optimal way to partition the computation.

For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to handle a portion of the computation. Typically, for a matrix multiply, you might use a block size of 32 or 64, but that depends on the specific dimensions. However, since the problem doesn't specify the exact dimensions, I need to make assumptions based on standard practices.

Let me think about the memory layout. The first matrix (A) is MxK, and the second (B) is KxN. The result matrix (C) is MxN. Each thread will compute one element of C. But in a standard matrix multiply, threads often compute a block of elements, but for this case, maybe each thread computes one element. However, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, using a block of threads to compute a submatrix.

Wait, but Triton is designed for high-performance, so maybe using a block size that allows for efficient memory access. For example, using a block size of 32, and each thread handles a certain number of elements. But I need to think about the strides and how to access the elements.

Let me recall that in Triton, each thread is responsible for a specific element in the output matrix. So for each thread, we have i (row index in C), j (column index in C). Then, the sum over k from 0 to K-1 of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But how to map this to the threads. Each thread would compute one element of C. However, for large K, this would be slow. So perhaps using a block size that allows multiple k's to be computed in parallel. But that's more complex.

Alternatively, using a block size that allows each thread to handle a certain number of k's. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread could handle 32 k's, but that would require a different approach. However, for the general case, maybe the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element, but with proper memory access patterns.

But for this problem, the user hasn't specified any particular constraints on the block size, so I can choose a standard one. Let me think about the memory access. For each element C[i][j], the threads need to access A[i][k] and B[k][j] for all k. So for each thread, the k index is varying from 0 to K-1. But if K is large, this would be slow.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written in a way that the threads are arranged in a grid and blocks. So for the matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that allows for each thread to compute a certain number of elements. However, in this case, since the problem is general, maybe we can use a block size that allows for each thread to compute one element of C, and then the kernel is written to loop over the k indices.

So, the steps would be:

1. Determine the grid and block dimensions. For example, the number of blocks in the grid would be determined by the number of rows in C (M) and columns (N). But since each block can handle multiple rows and columns, maybe the grid is determined by M and N.

But perhaps the kernel is written such that each thread is responsible for a single element of C. So, the grid is determined by M and N, and each block has a certain number of threads. But that might not be efficient.

Alternatively, using a block size that allows for each thread to compute a portion of the k indices. For example, using a block size of 32, and each thread computes 32 elements of k. But that would require more complex code.

Alternatively, using a standard approach where each thread computes one element of C, and the kernel is structured with loops over i, j, and k. However, this might not be efficient for large K, but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps it's acceptable.

So, the kernel would have:

- Each thread is responsible for computing C[i][j] = sum over k (A[i][k] * B[k][j]).

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by understanding what's required here.

First, the operation is matrix multiplication. So, the first tensor is of shape (M, K), and the second is (K, N). The result should be a tensor of shape (M, N). Each element in the result is the sum of the products of elements from the first row of the first matrix and the corresponding column of the second matrix.

Now, thinking about how to implement this in Triton. Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for GPU execution, so I need to make sure the kernel is efficient in terms of memory access and parallelism.

Let me recall the steps for matrix multiplication in Triton. Typically, each thread block handles a portion of the matrices. The key is to partition the matrices into blocks that can be processed by each thread. For example, each thread might compute one element of the result matrix.

But wait, in matrix multiplication, the standard approach is to have each thread block compute a block of the result matrix. However, for this problem, since the matrices are of sizes [M, K] and [K, N], the number of threads per block needs to be chosen such that each thread can compute a single element of the result.

But maybe I should think in terms of blocks. Let's say each thread block handles a block of size (block_m, block_k) for the first matrix and (block_k, block_n) for the second matrix. But I need to make sure that the blocks are aligned properly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more standard approach where each thread computes a single element of the result. That would be straightforward, but might not be the most efficient in terms of memory access. However, given that the problem is general, maybe that's the way to go.

Let me think about the memory layout. The first matrix (A) is of shape (M, K), and the second (B) is (K, N). The result (C) is (M, N). Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

In Triton, the kernel will have to process each element of C. So, for each element in C, we need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But how to structure the threads. Each thread would be responsible for computing one element of C. So, for each thread, we have i (row index in A and C), j (column index in B and C), and k (the index in the inner product).

But how to map the thread indices to these. Let me think: the kernel will have to iterate over all i and j, and for each, compute the sum over k.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the threads. So, the kernel will have to have a loop over i and j, and for each, compute the sum over k.

But that might not be efficient because for each thread, we need to loop over k. However, in Triton, the kernel is written in a way that's optimized for parallelism, so maybe using a more efficient approach with blocking.

Wait, maybe I should use a more efficient approach where each thread block handles a block of the matrices. For example, each thread block handles a block of size (block_m, block_k) for matrix A and (block_k, block_n) for matrix B. Then, each thread in the block computes a part of the result.

But I need to make sure that the block sizes are chosen such that they fit into the GPU's memory and that the memory accesses are coalesced.

Alternatively, perhaps using a standard approach where each thread computes one element of the result. Let me think about that.

In that case, the kernel would have to have a loop over i and j. For each i and j, the thread would compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. But this would require that each thread has access to the elements of A and B for the given i and j.

But how to structure the threads. For example, if the kernel is launched with a grid of (M, N), then each thread would be responsible for a single (i, j) pair.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the threads. So, the kernel would have a loop over the threads, and each thread would compute one element of the result.

But how to map the thread index to i and j. For example, if the kernel is launched with a grid of (M, N), then each thread would have a unique (i, j) pair.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the threads, and each thread is identified by a

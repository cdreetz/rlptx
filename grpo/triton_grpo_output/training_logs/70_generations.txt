Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in Triton.

First, the input tensors are A (M,K) and B (K,N). The result is C (M,N), where each element C[i,j] is the sum over k of A[i,k] * B[k,j]. But directly computing this with a kernel would be too slow for large K, so we need to use tiles and shared memory to optimize.

In Triton, the approach is to divide the matrices into blocks (tiles) that fit into shared memory. For each block, we compute the product and accumulate the result. The key is to use shared memory for the tiles of A and B to avoid repeated memory accesses.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. For each block, we'll load a tile of A (size block_size x block_size) and a tile of B (block_size x block_size). Then, we compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B.

Wait, but the dimensions need to be compatible. Let's say the block size is BLOCK_SIZE. For each element in the output matrix C, we need to compute the sum over k of A[i,k] * B[k,j]. So, for each i and j, we have to compute this sum. But with tiles, we can process multiple elements at once.

The kernel will need to iterate over the rows of A and columns of B. But since the matrices are large, we need to tile them. So, the kernel will process each tile of A and B, and compute the corresponding part of C.

Let me think about the indices. For each row i in A, and column j in B, the block of A is from i*block_size to (i+1)*block_size - 1, and the block of B is from j*block_size to (j+1)*block_size - 1. But wait, maybe I should think in terms of the tiles. For each tile in A, we load a block of size (block_size x block_size), and for each tile in B, we load a block of size (block_size x block_size). Then, the dot product between the rows of A's tile and columns of B's tile will contribute to the corresponding part of C.

But how to structure the kernel? The kernel will have a loop over the rows of A and columns of B. For each (i,j), we need to compute the sum over k of A[i,k] * B[k,j]. However, with tiles, we can process multiple (i,j) pairs at once.

Wait, maybe the kernel is structured as follows: for each row i in A, and for each column j in B, we compute the dot product between the row i of A and column j of B. But with tiles, we can process multiple rows and columns in parallel.

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured to process tiles of A and B. For example, each thread block processes a tile of A and a tile of B, and computes the corresponding part of C. But how to handle the indices?

Let me think about the parameters. The kernel will take the input tensors A and B, and output tensor C. The kernel will need to compute the product of A and B, storing the result in C.

The key steps are:

1. Load the tile of A into shared memory.
2. Load the tile of B into shared memory.
3. Compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B.
4. Store the result in C.

But since the kernel is for a single element (i,j), perhaps the kernel is structured to process each (i,j) pair, but with tiles. Wait, no. For matrix multiplication, the kernel is typically structured to process blocks of rows and columns. For example, each thread block processes a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B, and computes the corresponding part of C.

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured to process each element of C. But that would be inefficient. So, the better approach is to process tiles of A and B, and compute the corresponding part of C.

Let me think about the shared memory. The tile size is BLOCK_SIZE. For each tile of A, we load a block of size (BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE) into shared memory. Similarly for B. Then, for each row in the A tile, we compute the dot product with each column in the B tile.

So, the kernel will have multiple threads, each responsible for a particular element in the output matrix. But with tiles, we can process multiple elements at once.

Wait, perhaps the kernel is structured as follows: each thread block handles a block of rows in A and a

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should recall how matrix multiplication works. The standard approach is to compute each element of the resulting matrix as the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix. But with large matrices, this would be inefficient without optimization. So, using shared memory and tiling is essential here.

Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for GPU execution. The key is to divide the problem into tiles that fit into shared memory. For each tile, we'll load the corresponding rows and columns into shared memory, compute the dot product, and then store the result back into global memory.

Let me think about the input tensors. The first tensor A is of shape [M, K], and the second tensor B is [K, N]. The result C will be [M, N]. Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But how to structure the kernel? The kernel will process elements of C in blocks. For each block, we'll compute a submatrix of C. The tile size is important here. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a tile size of 32x32 is common, but I need to check the constraints.

The shared memory will hold a tile of A and a tile of B. Let's say each tile is of size TILE_M x TILE_K for A and TILE_K x TILE_N for B. Wait, but the actual tile size might be determined by the block size. Maybe the block size is TILE_M and TILE_N, but I need to think about how to structure the shared memory.

Wait, in matrix multiplication, each thread block typically handles a block of rows from A and columns from B. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread block handles 32 rows of A and 32 columns of B. But for shared memory, we need to load the tiles into shared memory. So, for each tile, we can load a block of A's rows and B's columns.

Let me outline the steps:

1. The kernel is launched with grid dimensions that cover the entire M and N dimensions. Each thread block handles a block of M and N.

2. Each thread in the block computes a single element of the result matrix C. However, with tiling, each thread block would compute a block of elements. Wait, no. Actually, in a standard matrix multiplication, each thread block processes a block of rows from A and columns from B. For example, if the block size is 32x32, then each thread block handles 32 rows of A and 32 columns of B. But for the shared memory approach, each thread block would load a tile of A and a tile of B into shared memory, then compute the dot product for each element in the resulting tile.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of threads per block. For example, if each thread block has TILE_M threads in the x-direction and TILE_N threads in the y-direction, then each thread computes a single element of C. But that's the naive approach. However, with tiling, we can optimize by loading tiles into shared memory and computing the dot products in a more efficient way.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread block handles a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. For example, each thread block is responsible for computing a submatrix of C. Each thread in the block computes a single element of C. But this is the same as the naive approach. However, with shared memory, we can load the necessary tiles into shared memory and compute the dot product more efficiently.

So, the steps would be:

- For each thread block, determine the range of rows in A and columns in B that it's responsible for.

- Load the corresponding rows of A into shared memory (each row is a vector of size K).

- Load the corresponding columns of B into shared memory (each column is a vector of size K).

- For each element in the resulting matrix, compute the dot product of the corresponding row from A and column from B.

But how to structure this in Triton? Let me think about the parameters.

The kernel will have parameters for the input tensors A, B, and output C. The kernel will be launched with grid dimensions that cover the entire M and N. Each thread block will handle a block of rows from A and columns from B.

Wait, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread block is responsible for a block of rows in A and a block of columns in B. For example, if the block size is TILE_M x TILE_N, then each thread block handles TILE_M rows of A and TILE

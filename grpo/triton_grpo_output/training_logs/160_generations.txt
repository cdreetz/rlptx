Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the maximum element). So for each row (each M row), we need to compute the max of N elements.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the maximum of the corresponding row.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Since we're processing each row independently, I can structure the kernel to handle each row in a block. The BLOCK_SIZE should be chosen based on how many elements we can process per block. For a 2D tensor, each row has N elements. If I use a block size that's a power of two, maybe 256, that's common. But I need to make sure that the number of threads per block is sufficient to process all elements in a row.

Wait, but for each row, we need to find the maximum. So each thread in the block could handle a portion of the row. But how to handle the reduction? For a reduction, we often use a warp-based approach where threads in a warp reduce the value. But since the rows are independent, maybe each block can process a single row.

Alternatively, since each row is independent, we can have each thread in the block handle a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction within the block. But for a row of N elements, if the block size is 256, then for N elements, we need to have enough threads to process all elements. But if N is larger than the block size, we need to split into multiple blocks. Wait, but the kernel is designed to process each row, so perhaps each block is responsible for processing a single row.

Wait, maybe the kernel is designed to process each row in parallel. So for each row, we have a set of threads that compute the max. But how to structure that.

Alternatively, think of the kernel as processing each row. For each row, we need to compute the max of N elements. So for each row, the threads in the block can work together to compute the max. So the kernel's program will have a loop over the rows, and for each row, perform a reduction.

But how to structure the threads. Let's think of the kernel as having a loop over the rows. For each row, the threads in the block will process the elements in that row. So the kernel's outer loop is over the rows (M), and for each row, the inner loop is over the elements (N). But that might not be efficient, because for each row, the threads would need to process the elements. Alternatively, for each row, we can have a reduction across the elements.

So, for each row, the threads in the block will compute the max. So the kernel can be structured with two loops: one over the rows (M), and for each row, a reduction over the elements (N). But how to handle the threads in the block.

Let me think of the block size. Suppose each block handles one row. For a row of N elements, the number of threads per block should be at least N. But if N is larger than the block size, that's not possible. So perhaps the block size is chosen as the maximum number of threads per block, and for each row, the threads process a portion of the elements, then perform a reduction.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, the number of threads per block can be up to the block size. So for each row, the threads will process elements in that row. For example, if the block size is 256, then for a row of N elements, the threads will process elements in a way that each thread takes a portion, and then the threads reduce the max.

But how to handle that. Let's think of the kernel as follows:

Each thread in the block is responsible for a certain element in the row. Then, the threads perform a reduction to find the max. However, if the number of elements in the row is larger than the number of threads in the block, then the threads will need to process multiple elements. But that's not straightforward.

Alternatively, for each row, the kernel can be structured such that each thread is assigned a unique element in the row, and then the threads perform a reduction. However, this requires that the number of threads per block is at least the number of elements in the row. But if the row has N elements, and the block size is 256, then for N < 256, each thread can process one element.

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let's start by understanding what this means. The input is a 2D tensor where each row has N elements, and we want to find the maximum value in each row. So for each row (each M element), we take the max of the N elements in that row.

First, I need to think about the GPU operations required. Since Triton is a GPU programming language, I'll be using tensor cores or CUDA-style operations. The kernel will process each row independently. So, each thread should handle one row. But wait, how many threads per row? Well, for a 2D tensor, each row has N elements. If I have a block size that can handle the elements in a row, maybe I can have each thread process one element. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe I can have each thread process a group of elements, but since we need to find the max, it's more efficient to have each thread handle a single element and compare with others.

Wait, for max reduction, a common approach is to have each thread process a portion of the data and compare with others. But since each row is independent, maybe each thread can handle one element in the row. But that would require a lot of threads. Alternatively, maybe we can use a block-based approach where each block processes a row, and the threads within the block work together to find the max.

But let's think about the memory layout. The input tensor is [M, N], so each row is of length N. The output will be a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the max of the corresponding row.

Now, the Triton kernel needs to process each row. So, for each row, we need to find the maximum value. Let's consider the threads per row. If each thread handles one element, then for a row of N elements, we need N threads. But if N is large, that could be a lot of threads. However, Triton allows for dynamic thread counts, so maybe that's manageable.

Alternatively, we can have each thread handle a group of elements. For example, if we have a block size of 16, then each block can process 16 elements in a row. But then, how do we compute the max across those elements? That would require a reduction step within the block. But since each row is independent, maybe we can have each block process a row, and then the threads within the block work together to find the max.

Wait, but if the block size is small, like 16, then each block can handle 16 elements. But for a row of N elements, if N is not a multiple of 16, we need to handle the remainder. However, since we're doing a reduction, the number of elements per block can vary. But maybe it's better to have each thread process one element, and then perform a reduction across the threads in the block.

So, the approach would be:

- Each thread is responsible for one element in the row.
- The threads in a block work together to compute the max of their elements.
- The block's result is then written to the output tensor.

But how to structure this. Let's think about the kernel parameters. The input tensor is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N], and the output is a 1D tensor of size M.

In Triton, each thread has an index. So, for each row, we can have threads that process each element in that row. But how to map the thread index to the row and element in the row.

Wait, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. So, for a row i, each thread in the block would process element j in that row. But how to determine which row a thread is processing. Alternatively, the row index can be determined by the thread index. For example, if there are M rows, then each thread can be assigned to a row. But that depends on how the threads are arranged.

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured such that each thread is assigned to a row. For example, if there are M rows, then the number of blocks is determined by the number of rows. But in Triton, the number of blocks is determined by the kernel's configuration.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed to process each row in parallel. For example, each block processes a single row, and the threads within the block work together to find the max of that row.

But how to handle the row index. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The kernel will take the input tensor, the output tensor, the dimensions M and N. Then, for each row, we need to process all N elements.

So, the kernel's main loop would be over the rows. For each row

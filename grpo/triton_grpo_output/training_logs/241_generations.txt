Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first matrix is MxK, the second is KxN, so the result should be MxN. Each element in the output is the sum of the product of elements from the first row and second column, summed over K.

In Triton, I need to handle the computation efficiently. Let's recall how Triton kernels work. They use a grid of threads, each handling a part of the computation. For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to have each thread compute one element of the result matrix. But since K can be large, we need to optimize the number of threads per block and the memory access patterns.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors are stored in row-major order. For the first matrix (A), each row is M elements, and for the second (B), each column is N elements. Wait, no, B is KxN, so each row of B has N elements. But when doing matrix multiplication, each element of the result is the sum over K of A[i][k] * B[k][j], where i is the row index in A, j is the column index in B, and k is the index in the common dimension.

So for each thread, I need to compute a particular (i, j) element. But how to structure the threads? Let's think about the blocks. Each block can handle a certain number of rows and columns. But since K is the common dimension, maybe each thread is responsible for a particular k? Or perhaps each thread computes one element of the result, but that might be too slow if K is large.

Wait, in standard matrix multiplication, the naive approach is O(M*K*N) operations. But with Triton, we can optimize by using shared memory and coalesced access. However, for this problem, since the matrices are [M,K] and [K,N], the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element of the result. But with K possibly being large, we need to find a way to process multiple elements efficiently.

Alternatively, maybe we can split the computation into blocks where each block handles a certain number of rows and columns. But I need to think about how to structure the threads.

Let me think about the dimensions. Let's assume that the kernel is designed to compute the entire result matrix. Each thread will compute one element of the result. The thread index can be determined by the row and column in the result. For example, the thread index in the block could be (i, j), where i is the row in the result and j is the column. Then, for each element (i, j), the thread needs to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But how to do that efficiently. For each k, the thread would need to load A[i][k] and B[k][j], multiply them, and accumulate the sum. However, if K is large, this would be slow. So, perhaps we can use a block size that allows for multiple k's to be processed in parallel.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a more optimized approach where each thread handles a certain number of k's. For example, if the block size is 32, each thread could process 32 k's. But that depends on the size of K. However, the problem is that for each thread, the k's would be in a range, and the memory access for A and B would need to be coalesced.

Wait, but in the case of matrix multiplication, the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element of the result. So, for each (i, j) in the result, the thread computes the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. However, if K is large, this could be slow. But with Triton, we can use shared memory to store the A and B slices, and then compute the sum in a way that's efficient.

But perhaps the optimal approach is to use a block size that allows for multiple k's to be processed. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread can process 32 k's. But then, the threads would need to be arranged in a way that each thread handles a different k. However, this might complicate the indexing.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard approach is to use a grid of threads where each thread computes one element of the result. Let's proceed with that approach.

So, the kernel will have a grid of threads, each responsible for a particular (i, j) in the result. For each (i, j), the thread computes the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to compute the product of two matrices A (MxK) and B (KxN), resulting in a matrix C (MxN). Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. 

In Triton, I need to structure the kernel to handle this efficiently. Let me recall how Triton works. The kernel is written in a way that's parallelized across threads, with each thread handling a specific element of the result. But since matrix multiplication is a dense operation, I need to think about how to partition the computation into blocks.

For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that allows for efficient memory access. Typically, for each thread, you might process a block of elements, but since K can be large, maybe using a block size that allows for coalesced memory accesses is important.

Let me consider the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order, which is standard for CUDA. So for A, each row is contiguous, and same for B. The output tensor C will also be stored in row-major order.

Now, the key is to figure out how to partition the computation. Each thread can be responsible for computing a single element of C. However, for efficiency, we need to process multiple elements in a way that minimizes memory access latency. 

In Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. But for matrix multiplication, it's more efficient to use a block size that allows for multiple elements to be processed in parallel. However, since each element of C requires K operations (summing over K terms), the block size needs to be chosen such that each thread can handle a subset of these K terms.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of how many elements each thread can compute. For example, if I have a block size of 32, each thread can handle a certain number of elements. But perhaps the standard approach is to use a block size that allows for each thread to compute a single element of C, but with proper memory access patterns.

Alternatively, maybe using a block size that allows for each thread to handle a block of K elements. But that might not be feasible if K is large. Let me think again.

In standard matrix multiplication, each thread block handles a submatrix of A and B. For example, a block of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K) for A and (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N) for B. But in Triton, the kernel is written in a way that each thread handles a specific element of C. However, for efficiency, we need to process multiple elements in a way that allows for coalesced memory access.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to have each thread compute a single element of C, but with the inner loop over K. However, this would lead to a lot of memory accesses. So, to optimize, we need to make sure that for each thread, the access to A and B is coalesced.

Alternatively, perhaps using a block size that allows for each thread to handle a block of K elements. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton.

In the standard Triton matrix multiplication kernel, each thread is responsible for computing a single element of C. The kernel is structured with three nested loops: for each i (row of A), j (column of B), and k (the inner loop for the dot product). However, this approach can be slow if K is large, because each thread has to perform K loads and multiplies.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements, and the inner loop is handled with a loop over the K terms. However, for efficiency, we need to make sure that the memory accesses are coalesced. For example, if each thread is responsible for a single element of C, then for each k in the inner loop, the thread would load A[i][k] and B[k][j], multiply them, and accumulate the sum.

But this would require that for each k, the memory accesses are contiguous. However, if the thread is processing a single element of C, then for each k, the access to A[i][k] is in the same row (so contiguous), and B[k][j] is in the same column (so contiguous). However, for a single thread, the inner loop over k would require that the memory accesses to A and B are in a way that allows for coalesced access.

But in reality, for a single thread, the accesses to A[i][k] for k from 0 to K-1 would be sequential, which is good. Similarly, B[k][j] for k

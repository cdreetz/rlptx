Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum each column of the matrix. So for each column (which is along the second dimension, since the tensor is [M, N]), we need to add up all the elements in that column. So for each row in the output, which will be a single value, we sum the corresponding elements from each row in the input tensor.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding column. Wait, noâ€”wait, if the tensor is [M, N], then the last dimension is N. So summing along the last dimension would result in a tensor of shape [M], since each element in the output is the sum of a column. So for example, if the input is 3x4, the output is 3 elements, each the sum of a column.

Now, the memory layout. The input is a 2D tensor, so in Triton, we'll probably have it stored in row-major order. Each row is a contiguous block in memory. So for a tensor of shape [M, N], each row is of length N.

For the kernel, we need to process each column. So the kernel should iterate over each column, and for each column, sum all the elements in that column. But how to structure this in Triton?

In Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the grid and blocks. Let's think about the block size. Let's say we have a block size of, say, 128. Each thread block will handle a certain number of columns. Wait, but if we're summing along the last dimension, maybe each thread block can handle a single column. Or maybe multiple columns, but that depends on how we structure the threads.

Alternatively, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element in the input tensor. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, we can have each thread block process a single column, and each thread in the block contributes to the sum of that column.

Wait, but for a sum reduction, each thread can process a portion of the column. For example, if the column has N elements, and each thread block processes a certain number of elements, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, since the sum is along the last dimension, maybe each thread block can handle a single column, and each thread in the block processes a single element in that column, adding it to the sum.

But how to structure that. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The input is a 2D tensor, and the output is a 1D tensor of size M. So for each column in the input (which is along the second dimension), we need to sum all the elements in that column.

So the kernel needs to process each column. Let's say that each thread block is responsible for a single column. So the number of thread blocks would be equal to the number of columns, N. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed to process multiple columns, but that depends on the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is designed to process each element in the input tensor, but that's not efficient for summing columns. Wait, but if the kernel is designed to process each element, then each thread would process one element, and then the sum is computed across all threads. But that's not the case here. Because for each column, all elements in that column need to be summed. So maybe the kernel is designed to process each column, and each thread in the block contributes to the sum of that column.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread block handles a single column. Let's think about how that would work.

Let me think about the kernel parameters. The input is a 2D tensor, say, of shape [M, N]. The output is a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding column. So for each column index j (from 0 to N-1), the output element at index j is the sum of input elements (i, j) for i from 0 to M-1.

Wait, no. Wait, the sum is along the last dimension. So if the tensor is [M, N], then the last dimension is N. So summing along the last dimension would mean that for each row (i), we sum across the N elements in that row? Wait, no. Wait, the last dimension is N. So summing along the last dimension would collapse that dimension. So for example, if the tensor is [M, N],

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is to sum each column of the tensor. So for each row in the tensor, we need to add up all the elements in that column. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the last dimension is N, so the reduction is along the N dimension. So for each row (assuming the tensor is [M, N], meaning M rows and N columns), we need to sum across the columns. Wait, no, the last dimension is N, so the reduction is along the N dimension. So for each row, we need to sum across the N elements. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

The tensor is of shape [M, N]. The last dimension is N. So the reduction is along the last dimension, which is N. So for each element in the first dimension (M), we need to sum all elements in that row. Wait, no. Wait, if the tensor is [M, N], then the last dimension is N. So the reduction is along the N dimension. So for each row (i.e., each element in the first dimension), we sum across the N elements. So for example, if the tensor is 2D, with rows and columns, the sum along the last dimension would be summing each row. Wait, no. Wait, if you have a tensor with shape [M, N], and you reduce along the last dimension (N), then each element in the first dimension (M) will have a sum of all elements in that row. So for each row, sum all the elements in that row. So the output would be a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the sum of the corresponding row.

Wait, but the question says "sum reduction along the last dimension". So for a 2D tensor, the last dimension is the second dimension. So the reduction is along the second dimension. So for each element in the first dimension (M), we sum across the second dimension (N). So the output is a 1D tensor of size M, each element is the sum of the corresponding row.

So the kernel needs to process each row, sum all elements in that row.

Now, how to implement this in Triton.

First, the input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N]. The output is a 1D tensor of shape [M].

Each thread will handle a particular row. Wait, but how to partition the work. Let's think about the kernel's grid and blocks.

In Triton, the kernel is divided into blocks. Each block processes a certain number of elements. For this problem, since we're summing along the last dimension (N), each block can process a single row. But since N can be large, we need to process each row in a block.

Wait, but maybe it's better to process each row in a block. Let me think: each thread in a block can handle a single element in the row. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each block can handle a range of rows. Wait, but the sum is along the N dimension. So for each row, we need to sum all N elements. So each row is processed by a block, and each thread in the block processes a single element in that row.

Alternatively, maybe we can have each block process a single row, and each thread in the block processes a single element in that row. But that would require that the number of threads per block is equal to N. But that's not feasible if N is large, because the number of threads per block is limited (typically 1024). So for N larger than 1024, this approach would not be efficient.

Wait, but the problem is that for each row, we need to sum all N elements. So for each row, we need to process all N elements. So perhaps the kernel should be structured such that each block handles a single row, and each thread in the block handles a single element in that row. But that would require that each block has N threads, which is not possible if N is large. Therefore, perhaps we need to process each row in a block, with multiple threads per block, but that's not possible. So maybe the kernel should be structured such that each block handles a single row, and the threads in the block process the elements in that row in a way that allows for efficient memory access.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each block processes a range of elements in the last dimension (N). But since the reduction is along the last dimension, perhaps the kernel is structured to process each row, and for each row, sum all elements in that row.

Wait, but how to structure the threads. Let me think of the kernel

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the minimum value in each row of a 2D tensor. So for each row (each M element), we need to find the minimum among the N elements in that row. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Now, considering how Triton kernels work. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing parallel kernels. The kernel will process elements in blocks, and each block will handle a certain number of rows. Since we're reducing along the last dimension (columns), each block should process a row and compute the minimum across all columns in that row.

Let me think about the input and output. The input tensor is 2D, with shape [M, N]. The output is 1D with shape [M]. Each element in the output corresponds to the minimum of the row in the input.

Next, I need to decide on the block size. Since each block will handle one row, the number of blocks will be M. But wait, if M is large, we need to make sure that each block can process a row. However, in Triton, each thread in a block can process a single element. Wait, no. Wait, for a reduction along the last dimension (columns), each row has N elements. So for each row, we need to reduce N elements. So maybe each block handles a row, and within the block, the threads process the elements of that row, reducing them to find the minimum.

But how to structure this. Let me think. For each row, the block will process all N elements. But with a block size that can handle that. However, if N is large, then the number of threads per block might be too big. So perhaps, the block size is set to a value that can handle the reduction efficiently. For example, if we have a block size of 128, then each block can process up to 128 elements in a row. But since N can be up to, say, 1024, then for each row, we need to process all N elements. So the block size needs to be such that it can process the elements in the row, and then reduce them.

Wait, but for a reduction along the last dimension (columns), each row is processed independently. So for each row, we need to compute the minimum of N elements. So each row is processed by a block, and within the block, the threads process the elements of that row, and then compute the minimum.

But how to structure this. Let me think about the kernel's parameters. The kernel will take the input tensor, and output tensor. The kernel will have a loop over the rows, and for each row, compute the minimum of the elements in that row.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows, and for each row, the threads process the elements in that row. Wait, but how to structure that. Let me think about the kernel's logic.

The kernel will have a loop over the rows. For each row, we need to compute the minimum of the N elements in that row. So for each row, we can have a set of threads that process each element in the row. But if the number of threads per block is too large, then for a row with N elements, we need to process all N elements. However, if the block size is too large, then the number of threads per block may not be sufficient to process all elements in a row. Wait, but for each row, the number of elements is N. So if the block size is 128, and N is 1024, then each block would have 128 threads, but that's not enough to process all elements. So that approach might not work. Therefore, perhaps we need to structure the kernel such that each thread processes one element in the row, and then the threads in the block perform a reduction to find the minimum.

Wait, but for each row, the number of elements is N. So for each row, the number of threads in the block should be such that they can process all elements. But that's not possible if the block size is fixed. Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that for each row, the threads in the block process the elements in that row, and then perform a reduction.

So, the approach would be:

- For each row i in 0..M-1:
   - For each column j in 0..N-1:
      - Load the value from input[i][j]
   - Reduce all these values to find the minimum.

But how to implement this in Triton. Let me think about the

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants a Triton kernel that computes the min reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. So, the input is a 2D tensor, and the output should be a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row in the input.

First, I need to think about the GPU operations required. Since we're dealing with a reduction along the last dimension, each row (of length N) needs to find its minimum. So, for each row in the input tensor, we'll compute the minimum value.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The input is [M, N], and the output will be [M]. The memory layout is important here. The input is stored in a 2D grid, so each row is contiguous in memory. The output is a 1D array where each element corresponds to a row's minimum.

Now, considering the block size and memory access patterns. Triton kernels typically use a grid of blocks, each processing a portion of the data. For this problem, each block can handle one row. But since the reduction is along the row, each block will process all elements in a row. However, since each row has N elements, and N can be large, we need to determine how to split the processing across threads in a block.

Wait, maybe each thread in a block processes one element in the row. But for a reduction, we need to find the minimum of all elements. So, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element, and then we perform a reduction across the threads in the block. However, since the row is of length N, the number of threads per block should be at least N. But if N is large, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can process the row in a way that each block handles a row, and within the block, the threads perform the reduction.

Alternatively, since each row is processed independently, maybe each block is responsible for a single row. Then, within the block, the threads can compute the minimum of that row. But how to split the row into threads. Let's think about the block size. Let's say each block handles one row. Then, the number of threads per block would be N. But that might not be efficient if N is large. However, Triton allows for dynamic block sizes. Alternatively, maybe we can use a block size that's a power of two, and process the row in a way that each thread handles a part of the row, then combine the results.

Alternatively, since the reduction is along the row, each thread in the block can take care of a single element, and then perform a reduction across the threads. For example, if the block has 128 threads, then each thread processes one element, and then they reduce to find the minimum. But this would require that the number of threads per block is at least the number of elements in the row. However, if N is larger than the block size, then we need to have multiple blocks processing different rows.

Wait, but the rows are independent. So, perhaps each block processes a single row. Then, the number of threads per block would be the number of elements in the row. But that might not be efficient for large N. Alternatively, maybe we can use a block size that is a power of two, and for each row, the threads process elements in a way that allows for reduction.

But perhaps a better approach is to have each thread process a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction across the threads in the block. So, for a row of N elements, the number of threads per block should be at least N. But if N is large, say 1024, then a block with 1024 threads would be needed. However, Triton allows for dynamic block sizes, but in practice, the block size is usually a power of two. So, maybe the block size is set to a power of two, and the number of threads per block is determined by the row length.

Alternatively, maybe the block size is fixed, and the number of threads per block is set to the number of elements in the row. But how to handle that? Well, perhaps the block size is set to the number of elements in the row, but that's not possible because the row length can vary. So, maybe we need to use a dynamic approach where the block size is adjusted based on the row length. However, in Triton, the block size is fixed when the kernel is compiled. So, perhaps the block size is chosen as a power of two, and the threads in the block process the elements of the row in a way that allows for reduction.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed such that each block handles one row, and the threads in the block process the elements of that row. For example, if the row has

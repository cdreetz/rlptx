Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first matrix is MxK, the second is KxN, so the result should be MxN. Each element in the output is the sum of the product of elements from the first row and second column, for each k in 0 to K-1.

In Triton, I need to handle this with threads. Each thread should compute one element of the output. But how to split the work among threads?

I remember that in Triton, you can use a grid and a block size. For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to have each thread compute a single element. But with large matrices, this might not be efficient. However, for the sake of this problem, maybe it's easier to go with that approach, especially if the matrices are not too big.

So, each thread will compute one element of the output. The thread index can be used to determine which element. But how to map the thread index to the row and column in the output matrix?

Wait, the output matrix is M rows and N columns. So for each thread, maybe the row is determined by the thread's row in the grid, and the column is determined by the thread's column in the block. But I need to think about how to split the work.

Alternatively, each thread can be responsible for a particular element (i, j) in the output. But how to compute that? For each element (i, j), the thread needs to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, the thread needs to iterate over k from 0 to K-1.

But in Triton, threads can't loop over K directly unless K is small. So, perhaps the kernel needs to have a loop over k, but that might be inefficient. Wait, but Triton allows for loops in the kernel. So, for each thread, we can loop over k and accumulate the sum.

But how to handle the memory access? The first matrix A is of shape [M, K], so each row is K elements. The second matrix B is [K, N], so each column is N elements. So, for each element (i, j) in the output, the thread needs to access A[i][k] and B[k][j] for each k.

But in Triton, the memory layout is important. Assuming that the tensors are stored in row-major order. So, for A, each row is contiguous. For B, each column is contiguous. So, for B, the memory layout is [K, N], so each column is stored as a contiguous block. So, for B[k][j], the index in memory would be k * N + j. But if the tensor is stored as a 1D array, then the indices would be computed accordingly.

Wait, but in Triton, the input tensors are passed as pointers, and the kernel needs to access them with proper indices. So, for A, if it's a 2D tensor, then the index for A[i][k] would be i*K + k. Similarly, for B, if it's a 2D tensor, then B[k][j] would be k*N + j. But this depends on how the tensors are stored. If the user passes them as 2D tensors, then the kernel needs to handle the indices correctly.

Alternatively, if the tensors are stored in a 1D array, then the kernel needs to compute the correct indices. So, for A, the element at row i, column k is at position i*K + k. For B, the element at row k, column j is at position k*N + j.

But in Triton, the kernel is given the pointers to the tensors. So, the kernel will need to compute the correct indices for each element.

So, the plan is:

- For each thread, compute the output element (i, j) where i is the row in the output, j is the column in the output.

- For each k in 0 to K-1, compute A[i][k] * B[k][j], and sum them all.

But how to map the thread index to i and j? Well, the kernel is designed to compute all elements of the output matrix. So, the grid size should be M * N, and each thread computes one element. However, that might not be efficient for large M and N, but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps it's acceptable.

But wait, in Triton, the kernel is called with a grid size. So, the grid size would be (M, N), and each thread is responsible for (i, j) in the output matrix.

But then, the kernel would have to loop over

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works. The result should be a [M, N] tensor where each element is the dot product of the corresponding row from the first matrix and column from the second matrix.

First, I should figure out the GPU operations needed. Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for parallelism, so I need to structure the kernel to handle each element of the resulting matrix. Each thread will compute one element of the output matrix. But wait, how to split the work among threads?

In matrix multiplication, each element (i, j) in the output is computed as the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So for each thread, I need to compute this sum. But how to partition this across threads?

I think the standard approach is to have each thread compute a block of elements. But since K can be large, maybe using a block size that allows for efficient memory access. Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order, right? So for A, each row is contiguous in memory, and for B, each column is contiguous.

Wait, but for B, since it's [K, N], each column is stored as a contiguous block. So when accessing B[k][j], it's a column-wise access. But in Triton, threads are usually arranged in a grid that can handle this.

Let me think about the thread indices. Each thread can be responsible for computing a particular (i, j) element. But how to manage the K dimension? Since K is the number of elements in the inner product, each thread would need to iterate over k from 0 to K-1, multiply A[i][k] by B[k][j], and accumulate the sum.

But if K is large, this could be slow. So maybe using a block size that allows for multiple k's to be processed in parallel. Wait, but in Triton, each thread is a single thread, so perhaps the block size is determined by how many elements of K each thread can process. Alternatively, maybe using a loop over k in the kernel.

But for efficiency, it's better to have each thread handle a single element of the output matrix, and compute the sum over k. However, if K is large, this could be slow. So maybe using a block size that allows for multiple k's to be processed in parallel. Wait, but in Triton, each thread is a single thread, so perhaps the block size is determined by the number of elements each thread can process in the inner loop.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread computes one element of the output matrix, and for that, it iterates over k. But that would require a loop over k, which could be slow if K is large.

Hmm, but maybe the kernel is designed with a block size that allows for multiple k's to be processed in parallel. Wait, no. Each thread is responsible for a single (i, j) element. So for each (i, j), the thread needs to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But how to structure this in Triton. Let me think about the parameters. The kernel needs to take the two input tensors, A and B, and the output tensor C. The shapes are M x K and K x N. So the output is M x N.

In Triton, the kernel is written with a grid and a block. The grid is determined by the number of rows and columns in the output. For example, each thread can be responsible for computing one element (i, j) in the output. So the grid would be (M, N), and each thread is assigned (i, j). But that's a lot of threads, but Triton can handle that.

But for each thread, the loop over k would be from 0 to K-1. However, if K is large, this loop could be slow. So perhaps the kernel is optimized with a block size that allows for multiple k's to be processed in parallel. Wait, but each thread is a single thread. So maybe the block size is determined by the number of k's that can be processed in parallel. But that's not straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured with a loop over k, and each thread processes a single k. But that would require a different approach. Wait, perhaps the kernel is designed with a block size that allows for multiple k's to be processed in parallel. For example, if the block size is 16, then each thread can process 16 k's. But that would require that the threads in the block work together to compute the sum for a particular (i, j) element.

But that seems more complicated. Maybe the

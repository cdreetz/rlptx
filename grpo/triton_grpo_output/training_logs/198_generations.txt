Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the tensor, find the max of that row). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the maximum of N elements.

Now, considering how Triton works, I need to figure out the grid and block sizes. Since we're dealing with a 2D tensor, each block will process a row. But wait, maybe each block can handle multiple rows? Or maybe each thread handles a single row? Let me think.

If I have a 2D tensor [M, N], each row is of length N. So for each row, we need to find the maximum. So each thread could be responsible for a single row. But how to process the elements in that row?

Alternatively, maybe each block processes a single row. But then, how many threads per block? Let's say each block has a certain number of threads, and each thread processes a single element in the row. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each thread handles a single element, but with some way to find the max.

Wait, the standard max reduction in Triton is done with a block that processes elements in a way that each thread compares with others. For example, in a 1D reduction, threads split the elements into groups, compare, and then reduce further.

But in this case, since each row is independent, maybe we can process each row in parallel. So each thread could be responsible for a single element in the row, and then compute the max for that row.

But how to structure the kernel. Let's think about the input tensor. Let's say the input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N], and the output is a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the max of the corresponding row.

So, the kernel needs to process each row. Let's think about the threads per block. Let's say each block handles one row. Then, each block has multiple threads, each processing a single element in that row. But that's not efficient, because for each row, we need to find the max of N elements. So perhaps each block can process a row, and within the block, the threads work together to find the max.

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then the threads in the block collaborate to find the max. That's similar to the standard max reduction.

So, for each row, we need to compute the max. So, the kernel will have to iterate over each row, and for each row, compute the max.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensor is [M, N], so each row is of length N. So, for each row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j for j from 0 to N-1.

Now, the kernel will need to process each row. Let's consider that each block processes one row. Then, the number of blocks is M. Each block will process the elements of one row.

But how to structure the threads within the block. Let's say each block has a certain number of threads, say BLOCK_SIZE. For each row, the threads in the block will process the elements of that row. For example, if the row has N elements, and the block has BLOCK_SIZE threads, then each thread handles a subset of the elements.

Wait, but for a max reduction, the threads need to compare their elements and propagate the maximum. So, perhaps each block is responsible for a row, and the threads in the block work together to find the maximum of that row.

So, the kernel would have:

- For each row i in 0..M-1:
   - For each element in the row, compute the max.

But how to structure this in Triton. The kernel will have to iterate over the rows, and for each row, process the elements.

But in Triton, the kernel is launched with a grid of blocks, and each block processes a certain range of elements. So, perhaps the grid is M blocks, each block handling one row. Then, within each block, the threads process the elements of that row.

But how to handle the threads within the block. Let's say each block has BLOCK_SIZE threads. For a row of N elements, the threads can be divided into groups. For example, if N is larger than BLOCK_SIZE, then each thread would process a portion of the elements. But for the max reduction, we need to have a way for threads to compare their values and find the maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then the threads in the block collaborate to find the maximum. For example,

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the max of the elements in that row). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the maximum of N elements.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the max of the corresponding row.

Memory layout: The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. The output tensor will be a 1D array where each element corresponds to a row's maximum.

Optimal block sizes and memory access. Since each row has N elements, and we need to process each row, the block size should be chosen to efficiently process the elements in a row. Let's consider using a block size that can handle the elements in a row. For example, if N is large, a block size of 256 might be good, but we need to make sure that each thread processes a portion of the row. However, since we're doing a reduction, perhaps a block size that can handle the reduction efficiently. Wait, but for each row, we need to compute the max of N elements. So each thread can take care of a subset of elements in the row, and then reduce them.

Wait, but for a max reduction, each thread can process a chunk of elements and then combine the results. However, since the elements are in a row, maybe we can process each row in a way that each thread handles a part of the row. But how to structure this.

Alternatively, since the rows are independent, maybe we can process each row in parallel. For each row, we can have a set of threads that compute the max of that row. So for each row, we have a group of threads that work on that row.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The kernel will take the input tensor, the output tensor, and the dimensions M and N. The kernel will process each row.

So, for each row i in 0..M-1, we need to compute the max of elements from column 0 to N-1 in that row.

In Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows. For each row, we can have a set of threads that process the elements in that row.

But how to structure the threads. Let's think about the threads per row. For each row, the number of elements is N. So, if we have a block size of, say, 256, then for each row, we can have multiple threads processing different elements. However, since we need to compute the max, we can have each thread take a chunk of elements and then combine the results.

But maybe a better approach is to have each thread process a single element, and then perform a reduction across the threads. Wait, but that would require that for each row, we have a reduction across all N elements. However, if N is large, this could be inefficient. Alternatively, we can use a parallel reduction approach where each thread handles a subset of elements and then combines them.

Alternatively, since the rows are independent, we can process each row in a way that each thread handles a part of the row. For example, for each row, we can have a set of threads that process a range of elements in that row, and then combine their results.

But perhaps the simplest way is to have each thread handle a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction across all elements in the row. However, that would require that each thread has a value, and then they combine their values to get the max.

But how to do that in Triton. Let me think about the kernel structure.

The kernel will have a loop over the rows. For each row, we need to compute the max of N elements. Let's say that for each row, we have a set of threads that process the elements in that row. Let's assume that the block size is such that each thread can process a chunk of elements.

Alternatively, perhaps using a reduction approach where each thread is responsible for a certain range of elements in the row, and then combining the results. For example, if the block size is 256, then for each row, each thread can process a certain number of elements, and then the threads reduce their results to get the max.

But how to structure this. Let's think about the code.

The kernel will have a loop over the rows. For each row, we need to process the elements in that row. Let's say that

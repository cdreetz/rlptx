Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to compute the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. Each row has N elements, and there are M rows. So for each row, I need to sum all elements and then divide by N. But since we're dealing with floating points, I should use proper data types, maybe float32 or float16 depending on the input.

Next, the input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row. So each output element is sum of the row divided by N.

Now, for the Triton kernel. The kernel will process each row. So I need to figure out how to loop over the rows and then the elements in each row. Since Triton is a GPU programming language, I'll use the triton library's features.

The kernel should be designed with a block size. Let's think about the block size. For each row, we need to process N elements. If the block size is set to a value that can handle the elements in a row, maybe 256 or 512. But since each row is processed independently, perhaps each thread can handle a single element in the row. Wait, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, each thread could process a single element in the row, but that would require a lot of threads. Alternatively, maybe each threadblock processes a row, and within the threadblock, the threads process the elements of the row.

Wait, the kernel is for a 2D tensor. So the rows are along the first dimension. So for each row, we need to sum all N elements. So the kernel should process each row, and for each row, sum the elements.

So, the kernel should have a loop over the rows. For each row, we need to sum the elements. So the kernel's outer loop is over the rows, and the inner loop is over the elements in the row.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a grid and a block. So the grid size would be the number of rows, M. Each block would process one row. Then, within the block, the threads process the elements of the row.

But how to structure this. Let's think: each thread in the block would handle one element in the row. So for a row, there are N elements. So if we have a block size of, say, 256, then each block can handle up to 256 elements. But if N is larger than 256, then multiple blocks would be needed for a single row. Wait, but that's not efficient. Alternatively, maybe each block processes a row, and the threads within the block process the elements of the row. But how to arrange that.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each threadblock processes a row. Then, the threads in the block process the elements of the row. For example, if the row has N elements, then each thread in the block would process one element. So for a row of N elements, the number of threads per block would be N. But that depends on the block size. So if the block size is 256, then for each row, we need to have N threads. But if N is larger than 256, then multiple blocks would be needed for that row. But that's not possible since each row is processed by one block. So maybe this approach isn't feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each threadblock processes a single row. Then, the threads within the block process the elements of the row. So for a row of N elements, each thread in the block would process one element. So the number of threads per block is N. But that's not possible if N is larger than the block size. So perhaps the block size is set to a value that can handle the elements of the row. But that depends on the input size. So maybe the block size is set to a value that can be used for different N.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is written with a loop over the rows, and for each row, the threads process the elements. But how to structure that.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is written with a grid that has M blocks, each block processing one row. Then, within each block, the threads process the elements of the row. For example, if the row has N elements, then each thread in the block would process one element. So the number of threads per block is N. But that's not possible if N is larger than the block size. So maybe the block size is set to 25

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to compute the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. So for each row (each M element), I need to sum all the elements in that row and then divide by N. But since Triton is a GPU programming language, I need to structure this in a way that's efficient on the GPU.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row. So for each row i, output[i] = sum(input[i, :]) / N.

Now, considering the memory layout. The input tensor is stored in row-major order, which is standard for CUDA. So each row is contiguous in memory. For each row, the elements are stored consecutively. So for row i, the starting index is i * N. So for each row, I need to load all N elements and sum them.

Optimal block sizes and memory access. Since we're processing rows, each thread can handle a single row. But how many threads per block? Let's think about how many rows there are. If M is large, we need to have enough threads to handle all rows. But Triton's blocks can have multiple threads. However, since each row is independent, maybe each thread can handle one row. Wait, but if M is large, that would require a lot of threads. Alternatively, maybe we can have each block process multiple rows. But for simplicity, maybe each thread handles one row. Let's say each thread processes one row. Then the block size would be 1, but that's not efficient. Alternatively, maybe each block processes multiple rows. But since each row is independent, maybe it's better to have each thread process one row. However, for large M, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can have each block process multiple rows, but that depends on the specific implementation.

Wait, but in Triton, each thread can process a single row. So for each row, the thread would load all N elements, sum them, then divide by N. But for that, each thread would need to process N elements. However, for N elements, if N is large, that would require a lot of memory accesses. So perhaps we can use a block size that can process multiple rows, but that's not necessary here. Alternatively, maybe we can use a block size that can process multiple rows, but since each row is independent, maybe it's better to have each thread handle one row. But then, if M is large, that would require a lot of threads. However, Triton can handle that.

But for memory access, if each thread is processing one row, then for each row, the thread would need to load N elements. But for that, the thread would need to access the elements in that row. So for row i, the starting index is i * N. So the thread would load elements from i*N to i*N + N-1. But how to do that in Triton?

Wait, but in Triton, each thread can have a unique index. So perhaps the kernel is designed to process each row. Let's think about the kernel parameters. The kernel will take the input tensor, the output tensor, and the dimensions M and N. Then, each thread is responsible for a single row.

So the kernel would have a loop over the rows. Each thread is assigned a row index. Then, for that row, sum all elements and divide by N.

But how to handle the sum? For each row, the thread would need to load all N elements. But that would require a loop over the columns. However, if N is large, that could be slow. But for a Triton kernel, maybe we can use a block size that can process multiple elements in parallel. Wait, but each row is independent. So maybe the kernel is designed to process each row in a separate thread. So each thread is responsible for one row.

So, the steps for the kernel would be:

1. For each row i in 0 to M-1:
   a. Compute the sum of elements in row i.
   b. Divide the sum by N to get the mean.
   c. Store the result in output[i].

But how to implement this in Triton. Let's think about the kernel code.

The kernel will have a loop over the rows. Each thread is assigned a row index. Then, for that row, we need to sum all elements in that row.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows. So perhaps the kernel is structured as follows:

@triton.jit
def

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that does element-wise addition of two 1D tensors. Let's start by thinking about what operations are needed. The kernel should take two input tensors and add their corresponding elements, then store the result in an output tensor.

First, the input and output tensors are 1D, so their shapes are (N,). The kernel needs to process each element in the tensors. Since Triton is a GPU programming language, I should consider how to structure the kernel for efficient memory access.

I remember that Triton uses blocks to process elements. The BLOCK_SIZE is usually a power of two, like 256. But for a 1D tensor, maybe the block size can be set to 256, and each thread in the block handles a portion of the data. Wait, but if the total number of elements N is not a multiple of the block size, there might be some leftover elements. So I need to handle that with masking.

The kernel should have three inputs: the two input tensors and the output tensor. Each thread will compute one element. But how to map the thread index to the element index? For each thread in the block, the index can be calculated as the thread's position within the block multiplied by the block size, plus the thread's index. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

In Triton, each thread in a block has a unique index. So for a block of size BLOCK_SIZE, each thread i (from 0 to BLOCK_SIZE-1) will handle element i * BLOCK_SIZE + j, where j is the thread's position. Wait, no. Actually, the thread index within the block is i, so the element index is i * (N / BLOCK_SIZE) + ... Hmm, maybe I should use the thread index to compute the position in the tensor. Alternatively, the kernel can process elements in a way that each thread handles one element, but that might not be efficient. Wait, no, for element-wise addition, each thread can handle one element. But if the block size is 256, then each block can handle 256 elements. But if N is not a multiple of 256, then some elements will be processed by threads in the last block.

Wait, perhaps the kernel should process each element in the input tensors. So each thread in the block will compute one element. The total number of threads is N, but that's not efficient. Wait, no. Wait, the kernel is launched with a certain number of blocks, and each block has a certain number of threads. For example, if the kernel is launched with num_blocks = (N + BLOCK_SIZE -1) // BLOCK_SIZE, then each block processes BLOCK_SIZE elements. But if the total number of elements is N, then each block will process up to BLOCK_SIZE elements, and the last block may process fewer.

But in Triton, the kernel is written in a way that each thread in the block processes a specific element. So for each thread in the block, the index is computed as the thread's position in the block multiplied by the number of elements per block. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

The kernel should process each element in the input tensors. So for each thread, we can compute the index in the tensor. For example, if the kernel is launched with a certain number of blocks, and each block has a certain number of threads, then each thread will handle a specific element. So the index for the thread is computed as the thread's position within the block multiplied by the number of elements per block. Wait, no. Maybe the kernel is written in a way that each thread is responsible for a single element. For example, the index is calculated as i * (N / num_threads) + ... Hmm, perhaps I need to use the thread index to compute the position in the tensor.

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured such that each thread handles a single element. The total number of threads is N, but that's not efficient. Wait, but Triton allows for dynamic programming. Maybe the kernel is written with a loop over the elements, and each thread handles one element. But how to structure that.

Alternatively, the kernel can be written with a loop over the elements, and each thread in the block handles one element. For example, the kernel has a loop over the elements, and each thread in the block handles one element. But how to compute the index for each thread.

Wait, perhaps the kernel is written with a loop over the elements, and each thread in the block processes one element. The index for each thread is computed as the thread's position within the block. For example, if the block has 256 threads, then each thread i (from 0 to 255) will process element i. But that's only if the total number of elements is at least 256. If N is smaller than 256,

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that adds two 1D tensors element-wise. Let me start by thinking about what's required here.

First, the GPU operations. The kernel needs to take two input tensors and add their corresponding elements. So for each element in the first tensor, I add it to the corresponding element in the second tensor. The result is stored in an output tensor.

Next, input and output shapes. The problem states that both input tensors are 1D of size N. So the input tensors have shape (N,) and the output will also be (N,). The kernel needs to process all elements from 0 to N-1.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels use warps and threads. A common approach is to use a block size that's a multiple of the warp size (usually 32). Let's say BLOCK_SIZE is 256. But since N can be any size, I need to make sure that the kernel can handle different N values. Also, each thread should process one element, so each thread is responsible for a single index.

Memory access patterns. The inputs are loaded into registers, then added, and the result is stored. For each thread, I need to calculate the index in the input tensors. The index is determined by the thread's position in the block. For example, if the block has 256 threads, each thread i in the block would process index i. But since the total number of elements is N, I need to check if i is less than N. If not, the thread should do nothing (maybe mask it out).

Edge cases: If N is smaller than the number of threads in the block, some threads will be out of bounds. So, I need to use a mask to skip those threads. The mask would be a boolean that is true if the index is valid (i < N), and false otherwise. When adding, the mask would ensure that only valid elements are added.

So the steps for each thread:

1. Calculate the index in the input tensors. For a thread in position i within the block, the global index is i.
2. Check if i is less than N. If not, skip (mask out).
3. Load the value from input1[i] and input2[i] into registers.
4. Add them together.
5. Store the result in output[i].

Now, the kernel needs to be written with the @triton.jit decorator. The parameters should include the input and output tensors, and the N value. The kernel will loop over each element, but since each thread handles one element, the loop is per thread.

Wait, in Triton, each thread is responsible for one element. So the kernel's main loop is over the elements, and each thread processes one element. The kernel will have a loop that runs for N elements, but each thread is assigned a specific index.

But how to handle the loop? Maybe the kernel uses a loop that runs for the number of elements, and each thread's index is determined by the thread's position. However, in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop that is controlled by the number of elements. So, the kernel will have a loop that runs for N times, and each iteration is handled by a thread.

Alternatively, since each thread is responsible for one element, the kernel can have a loop that runs for the number of elements, and each thread's index is computed as i. But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop that is controlled by the number of elements. Wait, maybe I should structure it as follows:

The kernel will have a loop that runs for the number of elements, and each thread is responsible for one iteration. However, since each thread is in a block, the block will process multiple elements. Wait, no. If each thread is responsible for one element, then the block size is determined by the number of elements. But that's not feasible for large N. So perhaps the kernel is structured with a loop that runs for the number of elements, and each thread's index is computed as i.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. In Triton, each thread is assigned a unique index in the range [0, N-1]. The kernel is written to process each element in the input tensors. So the kernel will have a loop that runs for the number of elements, and each thread is responsible for one element. But how to handle that in Triton.

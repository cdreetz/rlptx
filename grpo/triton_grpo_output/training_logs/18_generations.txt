Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that adds two 1D tensors element-wise. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The main task is to add corresponding elements from two input tensors and store the result in an output tensor. So, for each element in the input tensors, I'll add them and put the result in the output.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The problem states they are 1D tensors of size N. So, each input tensor has shape (N,), and the output will also be (N,). The memory layout is probably contiguous in memory, so each element is stored in a linear fashion.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels use warps and threads per warp. A common block size is 256, but maybe 128 or 256 depends on the problem. Since it's element-wise, each thread can handle one element. But maybe using a block size that allows for efficient memory access. For example, if each thread processes one element, then the block size can be set to 256, but each thread would have to calculate its own index.

Wait, but for efficient memory access, it's better to have threads access consecutive elements. So maybe using a block size that allows for a certain number of elements per thread. However, since the operation is element-wise, each thread can handle one element. So, the block size can be set to 256, and each thread will process one element. But then, the number of threads per block would be N divided by the block size. But since N can be any size, the kernel will launch enough blocks to cover all elements.

But how to handle the indices. Each thread needs to know its position in the array. So, the thread index within the block can be used to compute the global index. For example, each thread's index is i = tid + block_id * blockDim.x. Then, for each thread, we load the elements from input1 and input2 at position i, add them, and store in output[i].

But wait, in Triton, the kernel is launched with a grid size, and each thread in the block has a unique tid. So, the kernel will have to compute the global index for each thread. For example, if the kernel is launched with a grid of size (num_blocks, 1), and each block has blockDim.x threads, then each thread's index is tid + block_id * blockDim.x.

But how to handle the case where N is not a multiple of the block size? Well, Triton handles that by having the last block process the remaining elements. So, the kernel will handle that automatically.

Now, the memory access. For each thread, we need to load input1[i], input2[i], add them, and store in output[i]. But in Triton, the kernel needs to know the strides of the tensors. However, since the tensors are 1D and contiguous, the stride is 1. So, for each thread, the index is i, and the load is done with the correct offset.

But in Triton, when you pass the tensors to the kernel, you need to specify the layout. For example, if the tensors are passed as pointers, then the kernel can compute the offset as i * element_size. But in Triton, the kernel is written in a way that uses the pointer and the index to compute the offset.

Wait, in Triton, the kernel is written with the input and output pointers as parameters. So, for example, the kernel function would take input1, input2, output, and the N. Then, for each thread, compute the index i, then load input1[i], input2[i], add, store to output[i].

But how to handle the strides? Well, if the tensors are 1D and contiguous, the stride is 1. So, the offset for each element is i * sizeof(T), where T is the data type (float, int, etc.)

So, in the kernel code, for each thread, the code would be:

i = tid + block_id * blockDim.x
if i >= N: return

Then, load input1[i], input2[i], add, store output[i].

But wait, in Triton, the kernel is written with the input and output as pointers. So, the code would be something like:

@triton.jit
def kernel(input1, input2, output, N, ...):
    pid = tl.program_id(axis=0)
    i = pid
    if i >= N:
        return
    x = tl.load(input1 + i)
    y = tl.load(input2 + i)
    z = x + y
    tl.store(output + i, z)

But wait, in Triton, the kernel is written with the input and output as pointers, and the code uses the program_id to

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that adds two 1D tensors element-wise. Let me start by thinking about what operations are needed. The kernel should take two input tensors and produce an output tensor where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements from the inputs.

First, I should figure out the GPU operations. Since it's element-wise addition, each thread will handle one element. So, each thread will load the value from the first input tensor, load the value from the second input tensor, add them, and store the result in the output tensor.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The problem says they are 1D tensors of size N. So, each input and output tensor has shape (N,). The memory layout is probably contiguous in memory, so we can access them as pointers with strides of 1.

Now, block sizes and memory access patterns. Triton kernels are divided into blocks, and each block has a certain number of threads. For a 1D tensor, a common approach is to have each thread handle one element. So, the block size could be 1, but that might not be efficient. However, since the operation is simple, maybe using a block size of 1 is acceptable. But wait, maybe using a larger block size could help with cache efficiency, but for element-wise addition, each thread is independent, so maybe it's better to have each thread handle one element. So, the block size would be 1. But wait, in Triton, the block size is determined by the number of threads per block. For example, if we have a block size of 1, each thread processes one element. But maybe using a larger block size could help with memory access patterns. However, since each element is accessed sequentially, maybe it's better to have each thread handle one element. So, the block size is 1.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. So, for each element, the thread computes it. So, the kernel will have a loop that iterates over the elements, and each thread computes one element. So, the block size would be 1. But perhaps the block size can be larger if there's a way to process multiple elements per thread. But in this case, since it's element-wise addition, each thread can only handle one element. So, the block size is 1. But maybe that's not efficient. Alternatively, maybe the kernel can be written with a loop that processes each element in the tensor, and each thread handles one element. So, the block size is 1. But in Triton, the number of threads per block is determined by the block size. So, if the block size is 1, each thread processes one element. But for a large N, this would require many blocks. However, Triton can handle that.

Now, memory access. Each thread needs to load the i-th element from the input tensors and the output. So, for each thread, the index is i. The input tensors are passed as pointers, and each thread can access them via the index. So, for the first input tensor, the value is input1[i], and the second is input2[i]. Then, the output is output[i] = input1[i] + input2[i].

But how to handle the memory access in Triton? The kernel needs to take the pointers to the input and output tensors. So, the kernel function would have parameters for the input1, input2, output, and the size N. Then, the kernel loops over each element, and for each element, the thread computes the sum.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. So, the kernel would have a loop that runs for N elements, and each thread in the block processes one element. Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is divided into blocks, and each block has a certain number of threads. So, for example, if the block size is 1, then each thread processes one element. But if the block size is larger, say 256, then each block can process 256 elements, but that would require that the number of elements is a multiple of 256, which may not be the case. So, perhaps the best approach is to have each thread process one element, and the block size is 1. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, the kernel can be written with a loop that runs for the number of elements, and each thread in the block processes one element. So, the kernel would have a loop that runs for the number of elements, and each thread in the block processes one element. But how to handle that in Triton?

Wait, in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop that runs for the number of elements. So, for example, the kernel might look like this:

@triton.jit
def kernel(input

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that adds two 1D tensors element-wise. Let's start by thinking about what operations are required. The kernel should take two input tensors and produce an output tensor where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements from the inputs.

First, I need to figure out the GPU operations. Since Triton is a GPU programming language, the kernel will run on the GPU, and I need to use Triton's features for efficient memory access and parallelism. The main operation here is element-wise addition, which is straightforward.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The problem states that the tensors are 1D of size N. So, each input tensor has shape (N,), and the output will also be (N,). The kernel needs to process all elements in these tensors.

Now, considering block sizes and memory access patterns. Triton kernels are divided into warps, and each warp is divided into threads. The optimal block size depends on the problem. For a simple addition, a block size of 256 is common, but I should check if that's suitable here. Each thread will handle a single element, so the number of threads per block would be N divided by the number of threads per block. But since N can be large, I need to make sure that the kernel can handle different N sizes efficiently.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. So each thread will process one element. So the block size is determined by the number of elements per block. For example, if each thread processes one element, then the number of threads per block is N divided by the number of blocks. But since Triton allows for dynamic grid sizes, maybe I should structure the kernel so that each thread handles a single element, and the grid size is computed based on the input size.

But how to handle the indexing? Each thread will have an index, and then it will load the corresponding elements from the input tensors, add them, and store the result in the output tensor.

So, the steps would be:

1. For each thread in the block, compute its index i.
2. Load input1[i] and input2[i] from global memory.
3. Add them together.
4. Store the result in output[i].

But how to handle the memory access? Since the tensors are 1D, the memory layout is straightforward. The kernel will need to access the input tensors as pointers, and each thread will compute the offset based on its index.

Now, the kernel needs to be written with the @triton.jit decorator. The parameters would be the input tensors, the output tensor, and the size N. But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements, and the grid and block sizes are determined by the number of elements.

Wait, in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop that iterates over the elements. The number of threads per block is determined by the block size. For example, if the block size is 256, then each block handles 256 elements. But if N is not a multiple of 256, then the last block will have fewer threads. However, in Triton, the kernel can handle that by having the threads compute their index and check if it's within the range.

But for the element-wise addition, each thread is responsible for one element. So, the kernel should have a loop that runs for N elements, and each thread processes one element. However, in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop that is controlled by the number of blocks and threads per block. So perhaps the kernel is written with a loop over the elements, and each thread computes its index.

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured with a loop that runs for the number of elements, and each thread computes its index. Let me think: the kernel is written with a loop that runs for the number of elements, and each thread is responsible for one element. But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop that is controlled by the number of blocks and threads per block. So maybe the kernel is written with a loop that runs for the number of elements, and each thread is assigned an index.

But how to structure this. For example, the kernel could have a loop that runs for the number of elements, and each thread computes its index. However, in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop that is controlled by the grid and block sizes. So perhaps the kernel is written with a loop that runs for the number of elements, and each thread is responsible for one element.

Wait, maybe I should structure the kernel with a loop over the elements, and each thread is responsible for one element. So, for each element i in 0 to N-1, the thread computes i, loads input1[i], input2[i], adds them, and stores the result in output[i].

But how to compute i for

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that adds two 1D tensors element-wise. Let me think through the steps.

First, the GPU operations. The kernel should take two input tensors and compute their element-wise sum. Each element in the output is the sum of corresponding elements from the inputs.

Next, the input and output shapes. Both inputs and output are 1D tensors of size N. So, the kernel needs to process N elements. The memory layout is probably contiguous in memory, so we can access them with strides of 1.

For block sizes and memory access, Triton uses a grid and block structure. A common approach is to use a block size that divides the total number of elements. Let's say BLOCK_SIZE is 128. Each thread in the block handles a portion of the data. The threads will iterate over the elements, adding corresponding elements from the two inputs.

Handling edge cases: If N is not a multiple of the block size, the last block will have fewer elements. We need to make sure that threads in the last block don't access out-of-bounds indices. So, we'll use a mask to check if the index is within the valid range.

Now, the kernel structure. The @triton.jit decorator needs to be applied. The kernel will take the input tensors, their strides, and the number of elements N. Each thread will compute an index i, then load the values from the inputs, add them, and store the result.

Wait, how to handle the indices? Each thread in the block will compute its position in the global array. For example, the thread index in the block is i, and the global index is i + block_start. But since the block size is 128, the block start is determined by the grid size. But in Triton, the kernel is launched with a grid of size (num_blocks, ), where each block processes a chunk of elements.

Alternatively, the kernel can compute the global index as i * stride, but that might not be efficient. Wait, the inputs are 1D tensors, so each element is accessed with index i. The kernel needs to process each element in order.

Wait, the standard approach for 1D tensor addition in Triton is to have each thread handle a single element. So, for each thread, compute the index i = tid + block_start, then load input1[i], input2[i], add, store to output[i].

But how to handle the grid and block size? The number of blocks is ceil(N / BLOCK_SIZE). Each block processes BLOCK_SIZE elements. But if N is not a multiple of BLOCK_SIZE, the last block will process fewer elements.

So, in the kernel, each thread will compute its index as i = tid + block_start. Then, check if i is less than N. If not, mask out that thread. Then load the inputs, add, store.

So, the kernel code would look something like:

@triton.jit
def kernel(input1, input2, output, N, stride):
    pid = tl.program_id(0)
    i = pid
    # Compute the index in the global array
    # But wait, how to get the global index? Maybe the input tensors are passed with strides, but for 1D tensors, the stride is 1. So, each element is at position i.

    # Wait, perhaps the kernel is written such that each thread handles one element. So, the number of threads per block is 1, but that's not efficient. Wait, no, the block size is 128, but each thread processes one element. That would be inefficient. Alternatively, maybe the kernel is written with a block size that can handle multiple elements, but that's not possible if each thread is handling one element. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no. For element-wise operations, each thread can handle one element. So, the block size is set to 128, but each thread in the block handles one element. So, the total number of threads is N, and the number of blocks is ceil(N / 128). But that's not efficient, because each thread is handling one element. However, in Triton, the kernel can be written with a block size of 128, and each thread is responsible for one element. So, the code would be:

def kernel(...):
    pid = tl.program_id(0)
    i = pid
    if i >= N:
        return
    x = tl.load(input1 + i)
    y = tl.load(input2 + i)
    z = x + y
    tl.store(output + i, z)

But wait, how are the input and output tensors passed? The kernel needs to know the stride. For 1D tensors, the stride is 1. So, the kernel would take the input tensors, their strides, and N. But in Trit

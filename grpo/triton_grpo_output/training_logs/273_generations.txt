Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that adds two 1D tensors element-wise. Let's start by understanding the requirements. The user wants efficient memory access, so I should think about how to structure the kernel to minimize memory latency and maximize throughput.

First, the GPU operations. The main operation is element-wise addition. Each element in the first tensor is added to the corresponding element in the second tensor. The output is stored in a third tensor. So, for each element i, output[i] = input1[i] + input2[i].

Next, input and output tensor shapes. Both input tensors are 1D with size N. The output tensor is also 1D with size N. The memory layout is probably contiguous in memory, so each tensor is stored as a single contiguous array in GPU memory.

Now, block sizes and memory access patterns. Triton kernels use warps and threads per warp. A common approach is to use a block size that's a multiple of the warp size (32). Let's say BLOCK_SIZE = 128, which is 4 warps. But maybe 256 is better for larger N? Wait, but for 1D tensors, maybe a block size that's a power of two is better. Let me think. For each thread, it can handle one element. But if the threads are grouped into blocks, each block can process multiple elements. Wait, but for a 1D tensor, each thread can process one element. But if we have multiple threads per block, each thread can handle one element. However, if the block size is larger, maybe we can have more threads per block, but that depends on the N. For example, if N is 1024, then each block can process 1024 elements. But with 128 threads per block, each thread would handle one element. Wait, maybe that's not efficient. Alternatively, maybe using a block size that allows for better memory access. For example, if the threads are arranged in a way that they can access elements in a coalesced manner.

Wait, in a 1D tensor, each thread's index is i. So, if each thread is responsible for a single element, then the memory access is sequential. But if the threads are in a block, and each thread is assigned a different index, then the memory access is coalesced. But how to structure the kernel.

Let me think about the standard approach for 1D tensor addition in Triton. The kernel would have a loop over the elements. Each thread computes one element. The problem is that for very large N, the number of threads per block could be too small, leading to underutilization. But for a 1D tensor, each thread can handle one element. So, the kernel would have a loop over the elements, and each thread processes one element. However, in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements, and each thread is responsible for a single element. But how to structure that.

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured with a block size that allows each thread to process a single element. So, for each thread in the block, it computes the element at index i = thread_id + block_id * num_threads_per_block. But that's not right. Wait, in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. For example, the kernel might have a loop that iterates over the elements, and each thread in the block handles a specific element. But how to determine which element each thread is responsible for.

Wait, maybe the standard approach is to have each thread handle one element. So, the kernel has a loop over the elements, and each thread is assigned a specific element. For example, the kernel would have a loop that runs for the number of elements, and each thread in the block is responsible for a specific element. But that's not efficient because each thread would have to compute the same loop. Wait, no. In Triton, the kernel is written with a loop that is unrolled for each thread. So, for each thread, it computes the element at a specific index. So, the kernel would have a loop that runs for the number of elements, and each thread is responsible for a specific index. But how to structure that.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants a Triton kernel that adds two 1D tensors element-wise. I need to make sure it's efficient, so I should think about how Triton handles memory access and parallelism.

First, the operations. It's a simple element-wise addition, so each thread will process one element from each input tensor and add them. But I need to make sure that the memory access is coalesced. Since it's 1D, each thread's index is i = pid + offset. Wait, in Triton, each thread has a program ID, so I should calculate the index based on that.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. Both inputs are 1D of size N. The output will also be 1D of size N. The memory layout is probably contiguous, so each tensor is stored in a linear fashion. So for each thread, the index is i = pid + offset, but I need to make sure that the threads are in the same warp and that their accesses are contiguous.

Now, block size. Triton's default block size is 256, but maybe a smaller block size like 128 or 64 would be better for this case. Wait, but for element-wise operations, each thread can handle one element, so maybe the block size can be set to 256, and each thread handles one element. But I need to make sure that the threads are properly aligned. Alternatively, maybe the block size is 256, and each thread is responsible for one element. That way, the number of threads per block is 256, and each thread processes one element.

Wait, but for a tensor of size N, if N is larger than the number of threads, then each thread will process one element. So the kernel will launch with N threads. But in Triton, the kernel is launched with a certain number of threads per block, and the number of blocks is determined by the total number of elements. So for example, if N is 1024, then the kernel will have 1024 threads in a single block, but if the block size is 256, then there would be 4 blocks. But maybe the user wants to have a block size that's optimal for the given problem.

But for this case, since each thread handles one element, the block size can be set to 256, and the number of blocks is ceil(N / 256). But how does that affect the memory access? Each thread will access the input tensors at index i, and the output at index i. Since each thread is in the same block, their indices are contiguous, so the memory accesses are coalesced. That's good.

Now, the memory access. The inputs are passed as pointers, and each thread loads the value at i from input1 and input2, adds them, and stores to output. So in the kernel, the code would be something like:

def kernel(inputs1, inputs2, outputs, N):
    pid = tl.program_id(0)
    i = pid
    a = tl.load(inputs1 + i)
    b = tl.load(inputs2 + i)
    c = a + b
    tl.store(outputs + i, c)

But wait, in Triton, the memory access is done with tl.load and tl.store, and the pointers are passed as arguments. The problem is that for each thread, the index is pid, but if the kernel is launched with a certain number of threads per block, then each thread's i is unique. But for the case where N is not a multiple of the block size, the last few threads in the last block will have i >= N, which is out of bounds. So we need to handle that with masking.

So, the edge case is when i >= N. So we need to check if i is within the valid range. So in the kernel, after calculating i, we can check if i < N. If not, then we don't do anything. But how to do that in Triton?

In Triton, you can use a mask. So for each thread, we compute i = pid, then check if i < N. If not, then the load and store operations are masked out. So the code would be:

mask = i < N
a = tl.load(inputs1 + i, mask=mask)
b = tl.load(inputs2 + i, mask=mask)
c = a + b
tl.store(outputs + i, c, mask=mask)

But wait, in Triton, the mask is applied to the load and store operations. So the mask is used to determine which elements are valid. So for each thread, if i is beyond N-1, then the load would be masked, and the store would also be masked. So that way, the out-of-bounds accesses are avoided.

But how to

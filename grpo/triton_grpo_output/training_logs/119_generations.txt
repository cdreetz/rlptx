Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through the steps.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first matrix is MxK, the second is KxN, so the result should be MxN. Each element in the result is the sum of the product of elements from the first row of the first matrix and the corresponding column of the second matrix.

In Triton, I need to handle this with shared memory to optimize memory access. The idea is to tile the matrices into blocks that fit into shared memory. Let's decide on the block size. Common choices are 128 or 256, but maybe 128 is better for smaller matrices. Let's say each block is of size BLOCK_SIZE = 128. But wait, since we're dealing with two matrices, maybe the block size should be chosen such that both matrices can be tiled. For example, if the first matrix is MxK, then each block would process a part of it. But how to split the matrices into tiles?

In matrix multiplication, the standard approach is to split each matrix into tiles. For the first matrix (A), each tile is of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), and similarly for the second matrix (B). But since the second matrix is KxN, maybe the tile size for B is (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) as well. However, the actual dimensions depend on how we split them.

Wait, the first matrix is MxK, and the second is KxN. So, for each tile of A, we take a block of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), and for B, a block of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). But the problem is that K might not be a multiple of BLOCK_SIZE. So we need to handle that with proper tiling.

The kernel will process each element of the result matrix. For each element (i, j) in the result, we need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. But with shared memory, we can load a block of A into shared memory, and a block of B into shared memory, then compute the dot product between the corresponding rows of A and columns of B.

So the steps for the kernel:

1. Determine the block size. Let's choose 128. So each thread block will handle a tile of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) for A and B.

2. Each thread in the block will compute a part of the result. The threads will be arranged in a grid where each thread handles a specific element in the result matrix.

Wait, but in matrix multiplication, the threads are usually arranged in a way that each thread computes a single element of the result. However, with shared memory, we can compute multiple elements in parallel by loading tiles.

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured such that each thread block processes a block of the result matrix. But maybe that's more complex. Let's think again.

In the standard approach for Triton matrix multiplication, each thread block processes a tile of the result matrix. For example, if the result is MxN, then each thread block processes a tile of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) in the result. But how does that fit with the A and B matrices?

Alternatively, each thread in the block computes a single element of the result. But that would require loading the corresponding row from A and column from B into shared memory, then computing the dot product. But that might not be efficient if the matrices are large.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to split the matrices into tiles. For example, the first matrix A (MxK) is split into tiles of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), and the second matrix B (KxN) is split into tiles of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). Then, each thread block handles a tile of A and a tile of B, and computes the product. However, since the result matrix is MxN, each tile of the result would be (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). But this might require that M and N are multiples of BLOCK_SIZE. However, the problem statement doesn't specify that, so we need to handle cases where they are not.

But the user says to use tile-based computation with shared memory, so perhaps the approach is to load a tile of A into shared memory, load a tile of B into shared memory, compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B, and store the result in the output matrix.

But how to structure the threads. Let's think of each thread block as handling a tile of A and a tile of B. However, since A is MxK and B is KxN, the tiles would be (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) for A and

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by breaking down the problem.

First, I remember that matrix multiplication involves taking the dot product of rows from the first matrix and columns from the second matrix. For efficient computation, especially on GPUs, using shared memory and tiling is essential to minimize global memory access and maximize throughput.

So, the two input tensors are A (M x K) and B (K x N). The output tensor C will be (M x N). Each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k in 0 to K-1.

In Triton, I need to structure the kernel to handle this efficiently. The key steps are:

1. Determine the block sizes. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 elements is common. Let's say we use a block size of 32. But I need to check if that's optimal for the problem.

2. Shared memory usage: Each thread block will load a tile of A and B into shared memory. The tile size should be such that it fits into shared memory. For example, if the block size is 32, then each tile might be 32x32 elements. But since K can be larger than the block size, we need to tile the matrices into chunks.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of tiles. Let's say each tile is of size (block_size, block_size). For matrix A (M x K), each thread block will handle a tile of size (block_size, block_size). Similarly for B (K x N). But K might not be a multiple of block_size, so we need to handle that with masking.

But how does the tiling work here? For each thread in the block, it's responsible for computing a part of the output. The shared memory will hold a portion of A and B.

Wait, the standard approach for matrix multiplication with shared memory is to split the matrices into tiles. For example, if A is split into tiles of size (block_size, block_size), and B is split into tiles of size (block_size, block_size), then each thread block computes a portion of the output by multiplying these tiles.

But in this case, since A is M x K and B is K x N, the tiles would be of size (block_size, block_size) for A and (block_size, block_size) for B. However, K might not be a multiple of block_size, so there might be some padding or masking needed.

But perhaps the block size should be chosen such that the tiles fit into shared memory. Let's assume that the block size is 32. Then each tile of A is 32x32, and same for B. But for the matrix multiplication, each thread in the block would compute a part of the result.

Wait, maybe the block size is 32, and each thread block handles a tile of A and a tile of B. Then, for each thread in the block, it's responsible for computing a single element of the result. But that's not efficient. Instead, the threads should work in a way that they compute multiple elements in parallel.

Alternatively, for each thread block, the threads can compute a block of the result. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread block can compute a 32x32 block of the result. But that depends on how the tiles are arranged.

Alternatively, the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to have each thread block handle a tile of A and a tile of B, and compute the product. The threads in the block would then compute the dot product of rows from A and columns from B.

Wait, maybe I should think of the kernel as follows:

- Each thread block is responsible for computing a portion of the output matrix C. The block is divided into threads that handle different parts of the computation.

- The threads load a tile of A and B into shared memory. Then, each thread computes a part of the dot product.

But for this, the block size needs to be such that the threads can handle the computation. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread block has 32 threads. But that might not be enough for the computation.

Alternatively, the block size is 128, with 16 threads per block. Wait, but in Triton, the number of threads per block is determined by the grid and block dimensions. For example, a block with 128 threads can be divided into 16 threads per row and 8 per column.

Hmm, maybe I need to structure the kernel so that each thread block handles a tile of A and B.

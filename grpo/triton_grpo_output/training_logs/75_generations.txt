Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to compute the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. So for each row (each M element), I need to sum all the elements in that row and then divide by N. Since it's a mean, I have to handle the division properly, but maybe I can do it in a way that avoids division by zero, though the problem says N is the last dimension, so N should be non-zero.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

Memory layout: The input is stored in a 2D grid, so each row is contiguous in memory. The output is a 1D array where each element corresponds to a row's mean.

Optimal block sizes. Triton kernels usually use a block size that's a multiple of 32, maybe 128 or 256. But since each row has N elements, and we need to process all elements in a row, the block size should be chosen such that each thread can handle a portion of the row. However, since each row is processed independently, maybe each thread can handle a single element in the row. Wait, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each thread processes a single element, but that could be slow for large N. Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single row, but that would require that the block size is at least M. Hmm, but if M is large, that's not feasible. Wait, the problem is that each row is processed independently. So, for each row, we need to sum all N elements. So, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single row, and then sum all elements in that row. But how to do that efficiently.

Wait, but if the block size is large enough, each thread can handle a single row. For example, if the block size is 128, then each thread can process one row. But if M is larger than the block size, then we need multiple blocks. Alternatively, maybe the block size is set to 128, and each thread is responsible for a single element in a row. But that would require that each thread processes one element, and then the sum is computed across the threads in the block. But that's more complex. Let me think.

Alternatively, for each row, we can have a thread that processes all elements in that row. But that's not possible if the row has many elements. So perhaps the optimal way is to have each thread process a single element, and then the block computes the sum for that row. But how to do that.

Wait, let's think about the data layout. The input tensor is [M, N], so each row is of length N. For each row i, we need to sum all elements in that row. So, for each row, we can have a thread that processes all elements in that row. But that's not feasible if N is large. Alternatively, each thread can process a single element, and then the block computes the sum for that row. But that would require that each block processes one row. So, the number of blocks would be M, and each block processes one row. But if M is large, that's not efficient. However, since each row is independent, maybe that's manageable.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a grid where each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. Then, for each row, the threads in the block would sum all elements in that row. But that would require that each thread is assigned to a specific row and column. Wait, perhaps the kernel is structured as follows:

Each thread is responsible for a single element in the input tensor. Then, for each row, the threads in the block compute the sum of that row. But how to do that. Let me think about the indices.

Let me consider that the kernel is launched with a grid of M blocks (each block handles one row), and each block has a certain number of threads. For each block, the threads process the elements in that row. For example, if the block has 128 threads, and the row has N elements, then each thread would process one element. But if N is larger than the number of threads in the block, then the threads would need to process multiple elements. Wait, but that's not possible. So maybe the block size is chosen to be 128, and for each row, the threads in the block process the elements in that row. But how to handle that.

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is to compute the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. Since the tensor is [M, N], each row has N elements, and we need to compute the average for each of the M rows. So for each row, sum all elements and divide by N.

Now, considering Triton kernels, I need to structure the code to handle this efficiently. Let me recall how Triton works. The kernel is written in a way that uses threads to process elements in blocks. The key is to choose the right block size and memory access patterns to maximize throughput.

The input tensor is 2D, so I'll need to access each element in a row. Let's think about the thread indices. Each thread can handle a single element in the row. But since we need to sum all elements in a row, maybe each thread can be responsible for a single element, and then we can accumulate the sum for each row.

Wait, but if each thread is responsible for a single element, then for each row, we have N elements, and each thread would process one. But how do we group them? Maybe using a block size that allows each thread to process one element, and then the block can compute the sum for the row.

Alternatively, maybe using a block size that processes multiple elements per thread. But for a mean, the sum is needed, so perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element. Let's think about the steps.

The kernel will take the input tensor, and for each row, compute the sum of elements, then divide by N. So for each row i, sum over j from 0 to N-1 of input[i][j], then divide by N.

So the steps for the kernel:

1. For each row i in the input tensor, compute the sum of elements in that row.
2. Divide the sum by N to get the mean.

Now, in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows, and each thread processes a single element in the row. But how to structure the threads to process each element in a row.

Let me think about the thread indices. Let's say we have a grid of threads that processes each row. Each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. But since each row has N elements, and each thread can process one element, the number of threads per row would be N. However, if N is large, this could be inefficient. But for a mean, since we need to sum all elements in a row, perhaps it's better to have each thread process a single element, and then the block can accumulate the sum for the row.

Wait, but in Triton, each thread is part of a block. So perhaps the block size is set such that each block handles a single row. For example, if the block size is N, then each block processes one row. But that's not possible if N is large. Alternatively, maybe the block size is set to a value that allows each thread to process a single element in the row, and then the block can sum all elements in the row.

But how to structure the threads. Let's think of the kernel as processing each row. For each row i, we have N elements. Each thread in the block can process one element in the row. So the block size would be N, but that's not feasible for large N. So perhaps we need to use a block size that is a multiple of N, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread process a single element, and the block can accumulate the sum for the row.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows. So the first step is to loop over the rows. For each row, we need to process all elements in that row.

So the kernel might look like this:

For each row i in 0 to M-1:
    sum = 0
    for j in 0 to N-1:
        sum += input[i][j]
    mean[i] = sum / N

But how to implement this in Triton. Let's think about the thread indices. Each thread can be assigned to a specific row and a specific column. But since the kernel is written in a way that each thread handles a single element, perhaps the threads are arranged in a way that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row.

But how to structure the threads. Let's say that for each row i, we have N elements. Each thread in the block can handle one element. So the block size would be N. However, for large N, this would require a large number of threads per block, which might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe the block size is set to a value that

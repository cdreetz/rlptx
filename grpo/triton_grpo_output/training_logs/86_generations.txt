Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think through the steps.

First, the problem is to compute C = A * B, where A is MxK and B is KxN. The result C should be MxN. So each element C[i,j] is the sum over k of A[i,k] * B[k,j].

In Triton, I need to handle the computation efficiently. Let me recall how matrix multiplication is done in parallel. Each thread block should handle a block of rows from A and columns from B. But since the matrices are of different dimensions, I need to make sure that the block size is chosen appropriately.

The standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to use a block size that allows each thread to compute a portion of the result. For example, each thread might compute a single element of the result. However, with large matrices, this can be inefficient. So maybe using a block size that allows each thread to compute multiple elements, but I need to think about the memory layout and how to access the elements efficiently.

Wait, in Triton, the kernel is written in a way that each thread block processes a certain part of the matrices. The key is to have each thread handle a specific element of the result. Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. So for A, each row is contiguous in memory, and for B, each column is contiguous.

But for matrix multiplication, each thread needs to access elements A[i][k] and B[k][j], where k is the index in the middle dimension. So for a given i and j, the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

In Triton, the kernel will have to loop over the K dimension. But how to structure the threads. Let me think about the thread indices. Each thread can be responsible for a particular (i, j) pair. But for that, the thread index in the block can be mapped to i and j.

Alternatively, maybe each thread block handles a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. But given that the matrices are MxK and KxN, the block size needs to be chosen such that the threads can process the necessary elements.

Wait, the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to use a block size that allows each thread to compute a single element. So for each thread, we have i, j, and k. But in Triton, the threads are arranged in a grid where each thread block processes a certain number of elements.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured with each thread block handling a block of rows from A and columns from B. For example, each thread block handles a block of size (block_rows, block_cols) in the result matrix. But given that the matrices are MxK and KxN, the block size needs to be chosen such that the threads can access the necessary elements.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element of the result. So for each thread, we have i (row in A), j (column in B), and k (the index in the middle dimension). But since the matrices are of size MxK and KxN, the thread indices would be mapped such that each thread is responsible for a particular (i, j) pair, and the sum over k is computed.

But how to structure the threads. Let me think about the grid and the block dimensions. The grid is determined by the number of rows in A (M) and columns in B (N). So the number of thread blocks in the grid would be (M // block_rows) * (N // block_cols). But I need to make sure that the block size is chosen appropriately.

Alternatively, perhaps each thread block handles a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B. For example, each thread block processes a block of size (block_rows, block_cols) in the result matrix. But given that the matrices are MxK and KxN, the block size must be chosen such that the threads can access the necessary elements.

Wait, maybe the standard approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to compute a single element. For example, each thread is responsible for a particular (i, j) pair, and the sum over k. So the kernel would have to loop over k, and for each k, load A[i][k] and B[k][j], multiply them, and accumulate the sum.

But how to structure the threads. Let me think about the thread indices. The kernel is written in a way that each thread has a unique (i, j) pair. So the grid is determined by the number of rows in A (M) and columns in B (N). Each thread block is responsible for a certain number of

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first matrix is MxK, the second is KxN, so the result should be MxN. Each element in the output is the sum of the product of elements from the first row and second column, for each k in 0 to K-1.

Now, considering Triton's capabilities. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA. The key is to structure the kernel to efficiently use the GPU's resources.

For the kernel, I'll need to process each element of the output matrix. The main challenge is to compute the sum over the K dimension. Since K can be large, it's important to optimize the loop over K. But Triton's JIT compiler can handle this efficiently if the code is structured properly.

Next, the input tensors. Let's assume that the input tensors are stored in row-major order. The first tensor (A) has shape [M, K], so each row is K elements. The second tensor (B) has shape [K, N], so each column is N elements. The output tensor (C) will have shape [M, N], with each element being the sum over K.

Now, for the kernel, I need to decide on the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 is common. Let's pick 32 as a starting point. Each thread block will handle a portion of the M and N dimensions. But since the problem is matrix multiplication, the threads will need to compute elements in the output matrix.

Wait, in matrix multiplication, each thread can compute one element of the output. But if we have a block size of 32, each thread block can compute multiple elements. Alternatively, maybe using a more efficient approach where each thread block handles a tile of the matrix. However, since the problem is to compute the sum over K, maybe each thread can handle a single element of the output.

But for large K, the loop over K can be slow. So, perhaps using a more efficient approach where each thread block handles a block of K elements. But I need to think about how to structure the code.

Alternatively, the standard approach for Triton matrix multiplication is to have each thread compute one element of the output. So, for each element C[i][j], the thread computes the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But in Triton, each thread is identified by its index in the grid. So, for each thread, we need to compute the i and j indices for the output element. However, in the case of matrix multiplication, the threads can be arranged in a way that each thread handles a particular (i, j) pair.

But how to map the threads to the output elements. Let's think: the output is M rows and N columns. So, each thread can be responsible for a single (i, j) pair. The thread index in the grid can be used to determine i and j. For example, if the grid has M * N threads, then each thread can be assigned (i, j) as (thread_id // N, thread_id % N). But this may not be efficient for large M and N, but for Triton, it's manageable.

However, in practice, the kernel is written with a grid that has enough threads to cover all elements. But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the kernel will be structured such that each thread computes one element of the output.

But then, for each element C[i][j], the thread needs to loop over k from 0 to K-1, multiply A[i][k] and B[k][j], and sum them up. However, this loop over k is going to be a problem for performance, especially if K is large. So, perhaps we can use a more efficient approach, like using a block size that allows multiple k's to be processed in parallel.

Alternatively, using a block size that allows each thread to process a certain number of k's. But I need to think about how to structure this.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach for Triton is to use a block size that allows each thread to process a single element of the output, but with a loop over K. However, for large K, this could be slow. So, maybe using a more efficient approach where each thread block processes a block of K elements. But that's more complex.

Alternatively, maybe the code can be written with a loop over K, but with the use of shared memory to cache the A and B matrices. However, the problem here is that the user hasn't specified whether the tensors are in shared memory or not. But since the kernel is written in Triton, the

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The user specified using tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in Triton.

First, the matrices are A (MxK) and B (KxN). The result C should be (MxN), where each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k. But since we're using shared memory, I need to break this down into tiles.

Triton kernels typically use a grid of blocks, each handling a portion of the computation. For matrix multiplication, each block usually handles a tile of the matrices. The key is to load the tiles into shared memory, compute the dot product, and then store the result.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. For shared memory, I'll need to load chunks of rows from A and columns from B. The tile size is important here. Let's say each block handles a tile of size TILE_M x TILE_K for matrix A, and TILE_K x TILE_N for matrix B. Wait, maybe the tile size is determined by the block size. Let me check standard practices.

In standard matrix multiplication with Triton, the block size is often set to 32 or 64. Let me choose TILE_M = 32, TILE_K = 32, and TILE_N = 32. But the exact values depend on the hardware and the problem size. However, the user didn't specify, so I'll use common values.

So, each block will process a portion of the matrix. For each block, I need to load a tile of A (rows) and a tile of B (columns) into shared memory. Then compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B.

Wait, but in matrix multiplication, the rows of A and columns of B are multiplied. So for each element in the result, we need to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, for each block, I need to process multiple elements of C.

But how to structure this in Triton? Each thread in the block would handle a specific element in C. However, with tile-based computation, the block would handle multiple elements. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the block could process a tile of A (rows) and a tile of B (columns), then compute the product for the corresponding elements in C. For example, if the block is responsible for a tile of size TILE_M x TILE_N in C, then it would process the corresponding tiles of A and B.

But maybe the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element of C. However, with shared memory, we can load the tiles into shared memory and then compute the dot product in parallel.

Wait, here's a common approach: Each block handles a tile of A (rows) and a tile of B (columns). The block's threads compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B. So, for each row in the tile of A, we compute the dot product with each column in the tile of B.

But how to structure this. Let me think about the steps:

1. For each block, determine which part of the matrices it's responsible for. For example, the block's position in the grid determines the starting row and column in the result matrix C.

2. Load the corresponding tile of A into shared memory. Since A is MxK, each tile is TILE_M rows and TILE_K columns. Similarly, for B, each tile is TILE_K rows and TILE_N columns.

Wait, but B is KxN. So, each tile of B would be TILE_K rows (since K is the first dimension) and TILE_N columns. But the tile size for B is determined by the block's processing. Hmm.

Alternatively, the block's threads process a portion of the matrices. For example, each thread in the block computes a single element of C. But that would be inefficient for large matrices. So, using shared memory, we can load a tile of A (rows) and a tile of B (columns), then compute the dot product for each element in the tile.

But how to split this into threads. Let me think of the block as having multiple threads, each handling a different element in the tile of C. For example, if the block is responsible for a tile of size TILE_M x TILE_N in C, then each thread would compute one element. But that might not be efficient.

Alternatively, the block processes a tile of A (rows) and a tile of B (columns), and each thread computes the dot product between a row of A and a column of B. But that would require multiple threads per element.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through the steps.

First, I remember that matrix multiplication involves taking the dot product of rows from the first matrix and columns from the second matrix. So for each element in the resulting matrix of shape [M, N], I need to compute the sum of products of elements from the first matrix's row and the second matrix's column.

But since we're using tile-based computation, I should break down the problem into smaller tiles. Shared memory is used to store these tiles to reduce memory latency. The idea is to load tiles into shared memory, compute the dot product, and then store the result.

Let me think about the input tensors. The first tensor A is [M, K], and the second tensor B is [K, N]. The output tensor C will be [M, N]. Each element C[i,j] is the sum over k of A[i,k] * B[k,j].

Now, for the Triton kernel, I need to decide on the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 is common. Let's say we use a block size of 32. Each thread in the block will handle a portion of the computation.

But how to structure the threads? Each thread might be responsible for computing a single element of C. However, with tile-based computation, maybe each thread block handles a tile of A and B. Wait, maybe I should structure the kernel such that each thread block computes a block of the output matrix.

Alternatively, since the problem is to multiply two matrices, perhaps each thread block handles a portion of the computation. For example, each thread block could be responsible for computing a submatrix of C. But I need to think about how to tile the matrices.

Let me recall the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton. The kernel usually has a loop over the rows of A and columns of B, and for each element, compute the dot product. However, with shared memory, we can load tiles of A and B into shared memory, then compute the dot product using the shared memory.

So, the steps would be:

1. For each thread block, determine which tile of A and B it is responsible for.
2. Load the corresponding tiles of A and B into shared memory.
3. Compute the dot product of the tiles, which contributes to the output matrix C.
4. Store the result in the output tensor.

But how to split the matrices into tiles? Let's assume that each tile is of size (tile_m, tile_k) for A and (tile_k, tile_n) for B. However, since A is [M, K] and B is [K, N], the tiles would need to be arranged such that each tile of A is (tile_m, tile_k) and each tile of B is (tile_k, tile_n). The output tile would be (tile_m, tile_n).

But perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread block compute a block of the output matrix. For example, each thread block handles a block of M rows and N columns in the output. However, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, the block size is chosen such that each thread block can compute a block of the output matrix by using shared memory for the tiles.

Wait, maybe the kernel should be structured such that each thread block computes a block of the output matrix. For example, each thread block is responsible for computing a certain number of rows in A and columns in B. But I need to think about how to split the matrices into tiles.

Alternatively, each thread block is responsible for computing a tile of the output matrix. Let's say that each tile of A is of size (tile_m, tile_k), and each tile of B is (tile_k, tile_n). Then, the output tile is (tile_m, tile_n). The block size would be such that each thread block can compute a tile of the output.

But how to structure the threads. Each thread in the block would handle a particular element in the output. However, with shared memory, the threads can compute the dot product by loading the corresponding elements from A and B.

Wait, maybe I should structure the kernel as follows:

Each thread block handles a block of the output matrix. For each element C[i,j], the thread computes the sum over k of A[i,k] * B[k,j]. However, to do this efficiently, the kernel would need to load the corresponding rows of A and columns of B into shared memory, then compute the dot product.

But with shared memory, the threads can load the necessary elements from A and B into shared memory, then compute the dot product. However, the problem is that for each element C[i,j], we need to compute the sum over k of A[i,k] * B[k

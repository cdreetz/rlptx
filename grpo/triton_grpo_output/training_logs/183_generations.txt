Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to compute the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. So for each row (each M element), I need to sum all the N elements and then divide by N. But since Triton is a parallel kernel, I need to handle this efficiently.

Input and output shapes: The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

Memory layout: The input is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. For each row, I need to access all N elements. The output will be a 1D array where each element corresponds to a row's mean.

Optimal block sizes: Since each row has N elements, and we need to process all of them, the block size should be chosen such that each thread handles a portion of the row. But since the rows are independent, maybe each thread can handle a single element? Wait, no. Wait, for each row, we need to sum all elements. So perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, but that would require multiple threads per row. Alternatively, maybe we can process each row with a group of threads. But Triton's warp size is 32, so maybe using a block size that allows for efficient processing.

Wait, the standard approach for summing rows in a 2D tensor is to have each thread handle a single element in the row. But if the row has N elements, then for each row, we need N threads. However, if N is large, this could be inefficient. Alternatively, perhaps we can process each row in a way that each thread handles a chunk of elements. But for a mean, we need the sum of all elements in the row, so maybe the simplest way is to have each thread process one element, sum them up, and then divide by N.

But wait, if we have a block size of, say, 32, then each block can handle 32 elements per row. But since the rows are of length N, we need to make sure that the block size is a divisor of N? Or maybe not. Alternatively, each thread in the block can process one element in the row. So for each row, we have N threads, each processing one element. But that might not be efficient if N is not a multiple of the block size. However, Triton can handle that with proper indexing.

Wait, but in Triton, each thread is assigned a unique index. So for each row, the threads will process each element in the row. So for row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j for j from 0 to N-1. So each thread can be assigned a row index and a column index. But how to structure this.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. So for each row, each element is processed by a thread. Then, the sum for the row is computed by adding all the elements, and then divided by N.

But how to structure the kernel. Let's think about the kernel parameters. The input tensor is of shape [M, N]. The output is [M].

In Triton, the kernel is written with a function that takes the input and output tensors, along with the dimensions. The kernel will loop over each row, and for each row, loop over each column to sum the elements.

But in Triton, we can use the `num_threads` parameter to determine how many threads are in the block. For example, if we have a block size of 32, then each block will process 32 elements per row. But if the row has more elements, then multiple blocks are needed. However, this might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured to process each element in the row, with each thread handling one element. So for each row, the threads will process each element in the row. But how to map the threads to the elements.

Let me think about the indices. For a given row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j, where j ranges from 0 to N-1. So for each thread, we can have a row index i and a column index j. But how to assign these indices to threads.

In Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows, and then a loop over the columns. But since the kernel is parallel, each thread will be responsible for a specific (i, j) pair.

Wait, but in Triton, each thread is assigned a unique index. So the kernel can be structured as follows:

Okay, let's tackle this problem. I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. So the input is a matrix where each row is a sample and each column is a feature. The mean along the last dimension would be taking the average of each row. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the last dimension is N. So for each row (M rows), we take the average of the N elements in that row. So the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

First, I need to think about how Triton works. Triton kernels are written in a way that's similar to CUDA, but with some abstractions. The kernel will process elements in blocks, and each block will handle a certain number of elements. Since we're dealing with a 2D tensor, I need to figure out how to iterate over the rows and columns.

Let me think about the input tensor. Let's say the input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Each element is at position (i, j), where i is the row index (from 0 to M-1) and j is the column index (from 0 to N-1). The output is a 1D tensor of size M, where each element is the average of the row i.

So for each row i, we need to sum all the elements in that row and then divide by N. But since we're dealing with floating points, we have to be careful with precision. Also, we need to handle the case where N is zero? Wait, but the problem says the input is [M, N], so N is the number of columns. So N is at least 1, right? Or maybe not? Well, the problem says it's a 2D tensor, so N must be at least 1. So no need to handle N=0.

Now, the kernel needs to process each row. So for each row i, we need to process all elements in that row. So the kernel should iterate over each row, and for each row, process all the elements in that row.

But how to structure the kernel? Let's think about the threads. Each thread can process a single element in the row. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, we can have each thread block process a certain number of elements in a row. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block can process 128 elements in a row. But since each row has N elements, we need to calculate how many blocks are needed per row.

Wait, but the kernel is written in a way that each thread is responsible for a certain part of the data. Let's think about the memory layout. The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. So for a given row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j, for j from 0 to N-1.

So the kernel needs to process each row. Let's think about the steps:

1. For each row i in 0 to M-1:
   a. Sum all elements in row i.
   b. Divide the sum by N to get the mean.

But how to do this in Triton? Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The kernel will take the input tensor, and output tensor. The kernel will have to process each row.

In Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows, and then within each row, process the elements. But how to structure the threads. Let's think of the kernel as processing each row, and for each row, each thread processes a certain number of elements.

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. But that would be inefficient, as each thread would have to load a single element and add it to a sum. But maybe with a block size of 1, but that's not efficient. So better to have each thread block process multiple elements in a row.

So, let's decide on the block size. Let's say the block size is 128. Then, for each row, each block processes 128 elements. But how to handle when N is not a multiple of 128. So, for each row, the number of elements is N. So for each row, the number of blocks needed is ceil(N / BLOCK_SIZE). But how to compute that in Triton.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread block processes a single row. Wait, but that's not possible if the row has N elements. Because each thread block can process a certain number of elements. So perhaps the kernel is structured as follows:

Each thread block processes a single row. Then, within the block, the threads process the elements of that row. But how

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, matrix multiplication between A (MxK) and B (KxN) results in a matrix C (MxN). Each element C[i][j] is the sum of the products of elements from row i of A and column j of B. So, for each element in C, I need to compute the dot product of the corresponding row from A and column from B.

Now, considering Triton kernels, I need to structure the computation in a way that's efficient on the GPU. Triton uses a grid of threads, each handling a part of the computation. The key is to organize the threads into blocks that can efficiently compute parts of the matrix.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. For matrix multiplication, each thread block should handle a portion of the output matrix. But how to split the work?

In standard matrix multiplication, each thread can compute one element of the result. However, that's not efficient because it leads to a lot of memory accesses. Instead, we can use a block size that allows for better utilization of shared memory. For example, using a block size of 32x32 or 16x16, but I need to think about how to split the K dimension.

Wait, the K dimension is the common dimension between A and B. So, each thread in the block can compute a part of the K dimension. Let's consider that each thread block handles a certain number of rows in A and columns in B. But maybe it's better to have each thread compute a part of the K dimension. For example, if K is large, each thread can compute a subset of the K elements, and accumulate the sum.

But in Triton, each thread can handle one element of the output matrix. However, for efficiency, we can use shared memory to store a portion of A and B, so that each thread can access elements in a coalesced way.

Let me think about the block size. Let's say each block handles a certain number of rows in A (M) and columns in B (N). But since the K dimension is the same for both matrices, maybe the block should be organized to process a certain number of K elements. For example, if each thread in the block processes a certain number of K elements, then the block can handle multiple elements of the result.

Alternatively, using a block size where each thread computes one element of the result. But that would require each thread to iterate over K elements, which could be slow if K is large. So, perhaps using a block size that allows for a more efficient computation.

Wait, in standard matrix multiplication, each thread block can handle a block of rows and columns. For example, if the block size is 16x16, each thread in the block can compute a part of the result. However, for this case, since A is MxK and B is KxN, the block should process a portion of the K dimension.

Let me think about the indices. For each element C[i][j], we need to compute sum over k from 0 to K-1 of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, each thread can be responsible for a particular i and j, and compute the sum over k. But if K is large, this would be slow. To optimize, we can use shared memory to store a portion of A and B, and have each thread compute a part of the sum.

Alternatively, using a block size that allows for multiple k elements to be processed in parallel. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread can handle a certain number of k elements. But I need to think about how to split the work.

Wait, maybe the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element of the result. So, for each thread, we have i and j as the row and column in the result. Then, for each k in 0 to K-1, we compute A[i][k] * B[k][j], and sum them up. However, this approach would require each thread to iterate over K elements, which could be slow for large K. But with shared memory, we can store a portion of A and B to reduce the number of global memory accesses.

So, let's structure the kernel. Each thread block will handle a certain number of rows (i) and columns (j) in the result matrix. But since the result matrix is MxN, the block can be responsible for a subset of rows and columns. However, for this problem, perhaps the block is responsible for a single row i and a single column j, and compute the sum over k.

But that's not efficient. Alternatively, maybe the block is responsible for

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by understanding what's required here.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first matrix is MxK and the second is KxN, so the result should be MxN. Each element in the output is the sum of the products of elements from the rows of the first matrix and columns of the second matrix.

Now, thinking about how to implement this in Triton. Triton is a high-performance GPU programming language, so I need to make sure the kernel is optimized for GPU memory access and parallelism.

Let me recall the steps for matrix multiplication in Triton. Typically, each thread block handles a block of rows and columns. But since the matrices are of different dimensions, I need to decide on the block size and how to partition the work.

The standard approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to compute a single element of the output. However, for efficiency, it's better to have each thread handle a portion of the computation, perhaps using a tile-based approach. But since the matrices are MxK and KxN, maybe the block size should be such that each thread computes a single element of the output matrix.

Wait, but for matrix multiplication, the standard approach is to have each thread block compute a block of the output matrix. However, given that K can be large, maybe we need to use a more efficient approach. Alternatively, maybe using a block size that allows each thread to handle a single element of the output.

Alternatively, the standard way is to have each thread compute a single element of the output. So for each element (i, j) in the output, the thread would compute sum_{k} A[i][k] * B[k][j]. But for large K, this would be slow if each thread does this naively. So, perhaps using a more efficient approach with shared memory and tiling.

But the user hasn't specified any constraints on the input sizes, so I need to make assumptions. Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors are stored in row-major order, which is the default in many frameworks. So for the first matrix A (MxK), each row is stored contiguously. Similarly for B (KxN), each row is contiguous.

In Triton, the kernel will have to process each element of the output. So, the kernel will have to loop over the rows of A and columns of B, compute the dot product.

But for efficiency, it's better to use a block size that allows each thread to handle a certain number of elements. However, for the sake of simplicity, maybe start with a basic approach where each thread computes a single element of the output. But that might not be efficient for large K. Alternatively, use a block size that allows each thread to compute a block of elements, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, think about the standard matrix multiplication approach in Triton. The kernel is usually written with a block size that allows each thread to compute a single element of the output. For example, each thread is responsible for computing one element (i, j) in the output matrix. The threads are arranged in a grid that covers all the elements of the output.

But for that, the kernel would have to loop over the rows and columns of the output. However, the problem is that for each element (i, j), the thread has to compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So, the kernel would need to have loops over k, but that's going to be O(K) per element, which could be slow for large K.

So, to optimize, we need to use shared memory to store tiles of A and B, so that each thread can compute the dot product more efficiently. But the user hasn't specified any particular constraints, so maybe the standard approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to compute a single element, but with proper memory access patterns.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects a standard implementation that is correct but not necessarily the most optimized. However, since the user is asking for a high-performance kernel, I should think about optimizing it.

Let me think again. The matrices are A (M, K) and B (K, N). The output is C (M, N). Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

In Triton, the kernel will be written with a grid and a block. The grid will have M * N elements, each corresponding to a (i, j) in the output. Each thread will compute one element.

But for each element, the thread needs to iterate over k from 0 to K-1, multiply A[i][k] and B[k][j], and sum them.

But for large K, this is going

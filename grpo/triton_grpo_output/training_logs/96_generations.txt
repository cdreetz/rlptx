Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. Matrix multiplication involves computing the dot product of rows from the first matrix and columns from the second matrix. So for each element in the resulting matrix of shape [M, N], I need to compute the sum over K elements of (A[i][k] * B[k][j]).

Now, the input and output tensor shapes. The first tensor is MxK, the second is KxN. The output will be MxN. So the kernel needs to handle these dimensions.

Next, block sizes and memory access patterns. Triton kernels use warp-level parallelism. A common approach is to use a block size that's a multiple of the warp size (32). Let's choose BLOCK_SIZE = 256, which is a common choice. But I need to make sure that the threads are arranged in a way that allows efficient computation.

Each thread in the block will compute one element of the output matrix. But how to organize the threads? For each row i in the first matrix and column j in the second matrix, the thread computes the dot product. However, since K can be large, we need to split the computation into chunks. So, perhaps each thread is responsible for a certain number of elements in the K dimension. Wait, but in matrix multiplication, each thread would typically handle a single element of the output, but that's not efficient for large K. Alternatively, we can use a block-level approach where each thread computes a part of the dot product.

Wait, maybe I should structure it so that each thread computes a portion of the K dimension. For example, if K is 1024, and each thread handles 8 elements, then each thread would compute 8 elements of the dot product. But how to split that across threads.

Alternatively, using a standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton. The standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element of the output matrix. But for that, the threads need to be arranged in a way that each thread is responsible for a specific (i, j) pair. However, for large K, this can be slow because each thread has to perform K loads and multiplies. So, to optimize, we can use a block size that allows each thread to process multiple elements of K.

Wait, perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element, but with some optimizations. Let me recall. For example, in the standard Triton matrix multiply, each thread is responsible for a single element of the output matrix. The threads are arranged in a grid where each thread is assigned (i, j) for the output. Then, for each (i, j), the thread computes the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. But for that, the thread would need to access K elements from A and B. If K is large, this is inefficient.

So, to optimize, we can split the K dimension into chunks. Each thread can compute a portion of the K dimension. For example, if each thread handles a block of size 4 elements of K, then each thread would compute 4 elements of the dot product. But how to split that.

Alternatively, the standard approach is to use a block size that allows each thread to process a certain number of elements. For example, using a block size of 256, each thread can process a certain number of elements in the K dimension. But I need to think about how to structure the code.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. So, for A, each row is contiguous. Similarly for B. So, for a given i and j, the thread needs to access A[i][k] and B[k][j] for all k.

But in Triton, the memory access is done via pointers. So, for each thread, we need to compute the base address for A and B. For A, the base address is A + i * K. For B, the base address is B + j * K. Wait, no. Wait, B is a KxN matrix. So, each row of B is K elements. So, for B, the element at (k, j) is stored at B + k * N + j. Wait, no. Wait, the second tensor is K rows and N columns. So, each row is of length N. So, for B, the element at (k, j) is stored at B + k * N + j. But if the tensor is stored in row-major order, then yes.

But in the case of the matrix multiplication, for each element (i, j) in the output, the sum is over k from 0 to K-1 of A[i

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first matrix is MxK, the second is KxN, so the result should be MxN. Each element in the output is the sum of the products of elements from the rows of the first matrix and columns of the second matrix.

In Triton, I need to handle this with threads. Each thread should compute one element of the output matrix. But how to structure the threads? For matrix multiplication, a common approach is to have each thread compute a single element, but that might not be the most efficient. Alternatively, we can use a block-based approach where each block handles a submatrix. However, since the problem is general, maybe it's better to go with the per-element approach.

So, the kernel will have threads that iterate over the elements of the output matrix. Each thread will compute one element (i, j) by summing over the K elements of the dot product between the i-th row of the first matrix and the j-th column of the second matrix.

Now, the input tensors: the first tensor A is [M, K], the second B is [K, N]. The output C is [M, N]. The kernel needs to compute C[i][j] = sum_{k} A[i][k] * B[k][j].

But in Triton, how to handle the memory access? The tensors are stored in row-major order, I assume. So, for A, each row is contiguous. For B, each column is contiguous. Wait, no. If B is KxN, then each row is N elements. So, for B, the column j is stored as B[k][j], which is in a contiguous block if the matrix is stored in row-major. Wait, no. For a matrix stored in row-major, the elements are stored as row 0, then row 1, etc. So for B, the elements are stored as B[0][0], B[0][1], ..., B[0][N-1], then B[1][0], etc. So, for a given k, the column j of B is B[k][j], which is not contiguous. So, accessing B[k][j] would require a stride of N. That's a problem for memory access efficiency.

Wait, but in Triton, when you have a tensor, you can specify the strides. So, for B, if it's stored in row-major, then the stride for the second dimension is 1, and the first dimension is N. So, for B[k][j], the index is (k, j), and the stride is (N, 1). So, when accessing B, the memory is accessed with a stride of N for the first dimension.

But in the kernel, for each thread, we need to iterate over k from 0 to K-1, and for each k, get A[i][k] and B[k][j], multiply them, and accumulate the sum.

But how to handle this in Triton. Let's think about the kernel parameters. The kernel will need to take the pointers to A, B, and C, along with their strides. Also, the dimensions M, K, N.

So, the kernel will have parameters like:

@triton.jit
def kernel(
    A: tl.tensor, 
    B: tl.tensor, 
    C: tl.tensor,
    M: tl.int32, 
    K: tl.int32, 
    N: tl.int32,
    stride_a: tl.int32,
    stride_b: tl.int32,
    stride_c: tl.int32
):

But wait, in Triton, the strides are determined by the tensor's layout. For example, if A is a 2D tensor with shape [M, K], then the stride for the first dimension is K, and the second is 1. So, when passing the tensors, we need to pass their strides. But in the kernel, the strides are parameters that the user provides. So, the kernel would take the strides as parameters.

But how to handle this in the code. Let me think. The kernel will have to compute the indices for A, B, and C. For each thread, we need to compute i, j, and k.

But in Triton, each thread has a unique index. So, for the matrix multiplication, each thread is responsible for computing one element of C. So, the thread index can be mapped to i and j. However, in a standard matrix multiplication, the threads are arranged in a grid that covers all i and j. But for a Triton kernel, the grid is usually determined by the number of elements. However, in this case,

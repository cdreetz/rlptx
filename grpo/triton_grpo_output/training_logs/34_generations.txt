Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the matrix, find the max element). So for each row in the tensor, we need to compute the maximum of its elements. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the maximum of the corresponding row.

Now, considering how Triton works, I need to structure the kernel to process each row. Each thread should handle a row. But wait, in Triton, threads are organized into blocks, and each block can process a certain range of elements. So, perhaps each block handles a single row. But since the rows are in the first dimension, maybe each block is responsible for processing one row.

Wait, the tensor is [M, N], so each row is of length N. So for each row i, we need to find the maximum of elements from column 0 to N-1. So the kernel should iterate over each row, and for each row, iterate over all columns to find the max.

But how to structure the threads. Let's think about the grid and blocks. The grid should have M blocks, each block processing one row. Each block has multiple threads, but since each row is processed by one block, maybe each block has one thread per row? Wait, no. If each block is responsible for one row, then each block can have one thread that processes that row. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each block processes multiple elements in the row, but since the row is of length N, which could be large, perhaps we need to use a block size that can process the row efficiently.

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and the block is responsible for processing all elements in the row. But that might not be optimal. Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. So for a given row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j for j from 0 to N-1.

So for each row i, the kernel needs to find the maximum of the elements in that row. So the approach would be:

- For each row i in the grid:
   - Load all elements in the row into the thread's local memory.
   - Find the maximum among them.

But how to do this in Triton. The kernel will have to process each row. Let's think about the grid size. The grid should have M blocks, each block processing one row. Each block has a certain number of threads. But since each row is processed by one block, maybe each block has one thread. However, that would be inefficient if N is large. Alternatively, maybe each block processes multiple elements in the row, but that depends on the block size.

Wait, the problem is that for each row, we need to find the maximum. So, for a row of N elements, the maximum can be found by having multiple threads work together. For example, using a reduction approach where threads pair up and compute the max between their elements, then reduce further.

But since the row is processed by a single block, perhaps the block can perform a reduction over the row. So the block size would be such that each block can handle the entire row. For example, if the block size is N, but that's not feasible if N is large. Alternatively, the block size can be a power of two, and the threads in the block work together to compute the max.

But how to structure the kernel. Let me think about the parameters. The kernel needs to take the input tensor, and output the max for each row. So the kernel function would be something like:

@triton.jit
def kernel(...):
    # code here

But the input is a 2D tensor, so in Triton, the kernel will need to process each row. Let me think about the indices.

Each thread in the block will process a certain element in the row. But since the row is of length N, the block needs to process all elements in the row. So, for a given row i, the threads in the block will process elements j in 0 to N-1. But how to divide the work among threads.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then the threads in the block perform a reduction to find the max. So, for a row, the threads in the block will load the elements, and then perform a reduction.

But how to handle this in Triton. Let's think of the block size as a power of two. For example

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the tensor, find the maximum value). So for each row in the tensor, which is of length N, we need to compute the maximum. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the maximum of the corresponding row.

Now, considering how Triton works, I need to structure the kernel to process each row. Each thread should handle one row. But wait, how to handle the threads? Let me think about the grid and block sizes. Since each row is independent, I can have each thread process a single row. But maybe it's better to have multiple threads per row to handle the elements in the row. Wait, but for max reduction, each thread can take care of a portion of the row, and then combine the results.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, if I have multiple threads working on it, each thread would need to compute the max of a subset of elements and then combine them. But for a row, the maximum can be computed by having each thread take a chunk of elements and then compare them. But how to structure that.

Alternatively, since the rows are independent, maybe each thread can be responsible for a single row. Then, for each row, the thread would process all N elements to find the maximum. However, for large N, this might not be efficient. But given that Triton is optimized for parallelism, maybe it's better to have each thread handle a single row, and then compute the max for that row.

But wait, for a row of N elements, if each thread is responsible for one row, then for each row, the thread would need to iterate through all N elements and find the maximum. But that would require a loop inside the kernel. However, in Triton, loops are not as efficient as using warp-level parallelism. So perhaps a better approach is to have each thread process a chunk of elements in the row, and then combine the results.

But how to structure that. Let me think. For a row, the maximum can be computed by having each thread take a portion of the elements and then compare them. For example, if the row has N elements, and each thread processes a block of elements, then the threads can compute the max of their block and then combine them. But this would require some kind of reduction.

Alternatively, since the rows are independent, maybe each thread can handle a single row, and then compute the max of that row. But how to do that efficiently.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensor is 2D, with shape [M, N]. Each row is of length N. So, for each row i, the elements are at positions [i, 0], [i, 1], ..., [i, N-1].

In Triton, the kernel will have a grid of threads, each responsible for a row. So, the number of threads in the grid would be M. Each thread processes one row. Then, for each row, the thread needs to compute the maximum of the N elements in that row.

But how to do that efficiently. For each row, the thread can load all elements into registers, then compute the max. However, if N is large, this could be inefficient. But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, we can assume that N is manageable.

Alternatively, we can use a reduction approach. For each row, we can divide the elements into chunks, and have each thread compute the max of a chunk, then combine the results. For example, if the row has N elements, and each thread processes a block of size K, then the number of threads per row would be ceil(N / K). But this would require more complex logic.

But maybe for simplicity, given that the problem is to compute the max along the last dimension, and given that the rows are independent, the simplest approach is to have each thread process a single row, and then compute the max of that row by iterating through all elements.

But how to do that in Triton. Let me think about the code structure.

First, the kernel would need to take the input tensor, and output tensor. The input is [M, N], output is [M]. Each thread is responsible for a row i. Then, for that row, the thread needs to compute the max of the elements in that row.

So, the code would be something like:

@triton.jit
def kernel(input: tl.tensor, output: tl.tensor):
    pid = tl.program_id(axis=0)
    i = pid
    # For row i, compute max of input[i, :]

But how to compute the max of the row.

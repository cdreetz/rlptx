Okay, let's see. The user wants a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. So, the first thing I need to remember is how matrix multiplication works here. The first matrix is MxK, the second is KxN, so the result should be MxN. Each element in the result is the dot product of the corresponding row from the first matrix and column from the second.

Now, thinking about Triton kernels. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA, but with more abstraction. The key is to structure the kernel to efficiently use the GPU's resources, like memory access patterns and thread blocks.

First, I need to figure out the dimensions. The first matrix (A) has shape [M, K], the second (B) [K, N]. The output matrix (C) will be [M, N]. Each element C[i, j] is the sum over k of A[i, k] * B[k, j].

In Triton, each thread block will handle a certain portion of the matrices. So, I need to decide how to partition the work. Typically, for matrix multiplication, you can have each thread block handle a block of rows and columns. But since the problem is MxK and KxN, maybe the block size should be such that each thread handles a small part of the computation.

Wait, the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to have each thread compute one element of the result. But that's not efficient because of the memory access patterns. Alternatively, you can use a block-based approach where each block handles a submatrix. However, given that K can be large, maybe it's better to have each thread compute a single element, but with proper memory access.

But for efficiency, it's better to have each thread block process a block of elements. Let me think. For example, if we have a block size of 32, then each thread block can handle a certain number of rows and columns. But I need to make sure that the threads can access the required elements in a coalesced manner.

Wait, the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to have each thread compute a single element of the result. But that's not efficient because each element requires accessing K elements from A and B. So, for each element C[i,j], you need to loop over k from 0 to K-1, multiply A[i,k] and B[k,j], and sum. But if K is large, this loop can be slow.

Alternatively, you can use a block-based approach where each thread block handles a block of K elements. But that depends on the size of K. However, since the problem is general, the kernel needs to handle any K. So maybe the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element, but with proper memory access.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. So, the kernel will have to loop over the rows of A and columns of B, and for each element, compute the sum over k.

But how to structure this. Let me think about the parameters. The kernel needs to take the two input tensors A and B, and output tensor C. The shapes are M x K and K x N. So, the kernel needs to process each element of C, which is M x N.

In Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. So, the first step is to define the kernel function with the appropriate parameters.

The kernel will have to handle the indices i and j for the output matrix. For each i and j, compute the sum over k of A[i, k] * B[k, j].

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. So, the kernel will have to iterate over i and j, and for each, compute the sum over k.

But for efficiency, the kernel should have a loop over k, but that would be a loop inside the kernel. However, in Triton, the loops are written in the kernel code, and the kernel is compiled with the loop unrolling or other optimizations.

But for a general case, perhaps the kernel is written with a loop over the elements of C, and for each element, compute the sum over k. However, that would be O(M*N*K) operations, which is not efficient for large K. But maybe for the purpose of this problem, the user just wants a correct kernel, even if it's not the most optimized.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is written with a block-based approach where each thread block handles a block of rows and columns. But I need to think about the memory layout.

Assuming that the input tensors are stored in row-major order. So, for A, each row is contiguous in memory. Similarly for B.

So, for the kernel, each thread will compute a single

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. Matrix multiplication involves taking the dot product of rows from the first matrix and columns from the second matrix. So for each element in the resulting matrix of shape [M, N], I need to compute the sum over K elements of (A[i][k] * B[k][j]).

Now, the input and output tensor shapes. The first tensor A is M x K, the second B is K x N. The output C will be M x N. So each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

Next, block sizes and memory access patterns. Triton kernels use warps and threads per warp. A common approach is to use a block size that's a multiple of 32, like 256. But for matrix multiplication, the block size needs to handle the dimensions. Let me think about how to partition the matrices into blocks.

Each thread in the block can handle a portion of the K dimension. So, for each thread, I'll compute a part of the dot product. The number of threads per block should be such that each thread can handle a chunk of K. Let's say BLOCK_SIZE is 256. But maybe I need to adjust based on K's size. Alternatively, using a block size that's a multiple of 32, like 128 or 256.

Wait, the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to use a block size that allows each thread to compute a part of the K dimension. For example, each thread computes a portion of the K dimension, and the block size is chosen such that each thread can handle a certain number of elements. But I need to make sure that the threads are arranged in a way that allows efficient memory access.

So, the kernel will have a loop over the K dimension. Each thread will compute a part of the sum. The key is to ensure that the memory accesses are coalesced. For the first matrix A, each thread will access A[i][k], and for B, each thread will access B[k][j]. But since the K dimension is the same for both matrices, maybe each thread can handle a range of k's.

Wait, but in the standard approach, each thread is responsible for a certain element in the output matrix. For example, in the case of matrix multiplication, each thread might compute a part of the dot product. But how to split the K dimension among threads.

Alternatively, using a block size of 128, each thread can handle a certain number of K elements. Let me think of the block size as being divided into two parts: one for the rows of A and one for the columns of B. But I need to make sure that the threads can access the elements in a way that allows for coalesced memory access.

Another consideration is the memory layout. The input tensors A and B should be stored in row-major order, which is the default for most frameworks. So, for A, each row is contiguous in memory. Similarly for B.

So, for each thread, the index i (row of A) and j (column of B) are determined by the thread's position in the block. Then, for each k in the K dimension, the thread would compute A[i][k] * B[k][j], and accumulate the sum.

But how to split the K dimension into chunks that each thread can process. Let's say that each thread is responsible for a certain range of k's. For example, if the block size is 128, each thread could handle 16 elements of K. But this depends on the size of K. However, the kernel needs to be general enough for any K.

Alternatively, using a block size that's a multiple of 32, and each thread handles a certain number of elements. For example, if the block size is 128, then each thread can handle 16 elements of K (since 128 / 8 = 16, but maybe that's not the right way to think about it). Wait, maybe the block size is divided into two parts: one for the K dimension and one for the other dimensions. But I'm getting confused.

Let me recall the standard Triton matrix multiplication approach. In the standard implementation, each thread is responsible for computing a single element in the output matrix. The thread's index in the block determines the row i and column j of the output. Then, the thread computes the dot product over the K dimension. However, this approach can be inefficient because each thread has to loop over K elements, which can be slow for large K.

To optimize, the kernel can be designed to have each thread compute a portion of the K dimension

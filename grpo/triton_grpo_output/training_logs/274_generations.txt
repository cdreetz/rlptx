Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the maximum value). So for each row (each M element), I need to compute the max of N elements.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the max of the corresponding row.

Memory layout: The input is stored in a 2D grid, so each row is contiguous in memory. The output is a 1D array where each element corresponds to a row's max.

Optimal block sizes and memory access patterns. Since we're processing rows, each threadblock should handle one row. But since each row has N elements, the number of threads per block depends on N. However, if N is large, maybe we can have each thread handle a single element in the row. But for better performance, perhaps we can have each threadblock process a row, with each thread handling a single element. Wait, but for max reduction, each threadblock can process a row, and each thread can take care of a part of the row. Alternatively, maybe using a block size that can handle the row in a way that allows for efficient reduction.

Wait, for max reduction along a row, the standard approach is to have each thread process a single element, and then perform a reduction. But since the row is of length N, the number of threads per block would be N, but that might not be efficient if N is large. Alternatively, using a block size that can handle the row in a way that allows for parallel reduction.

But maybe for simplicity, since the row is of length N, we can have each threadblock process a row, and each thread in the block handles a single element. Then, the threads in the block perform a reduction to find the max. However, that would require that the block size is at least N, but that's not feasible for large N. So perhaps a better approach is to use a block size that can handle the row in a way that allows for a reduction.

Alternatively, think of the row as a 1D array, and use a reduction kernel. For each row, the threads in the block process elements in the row, and perform a reduction. So for each row, the block size is determined by the number of elements in the row. But in Triton, the kernel is written with a fixed block size, so we need to choose a block size that can handle the row's elements.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written with a fixed number of threads per block. So for each row, the number of threads per block would be the number of elements in the row. But if the row is of length N, then the block size would be N. However, that's not efficient if N is large, but perhaps for the sake of this problem, we can proceed with that approach.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed to process each row, and each thread in the block handles a single element. Then, the threads in the block perform a reduction to find the maximum. But for that, the block size needs to be at least the number of elements in the row. However, if N is large, this might not be feasible. So perhaps the block size is chosen as a power of two, and the threads in the block process elements in the row, but that might require more complex logic.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed to process each row in a way that each threadblock handles a single row, and each thread in the block is responsible for a single element in the row. Then, the threads in the block perform a reduction to find the max. But for that, the number of threads per block would be N, which is the length of the row. However, if N is large, this could be a problem. But given that the problem is to compute the max along the last dimension, perhaps the kernel is designed to process each row in a way that each threadblock handles a row, and each thread in the block is responsible for a single element. Then, the threads in the block perform a reduction.

But how to handle this in Triton? Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The kernel needs to process each row, so the row index is determined by the thread's index. For example, each threadblock is responsible for a row, and the threads in the block process elements in that row.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written with a grid and a block size. So for each row, the kernel is launched with a block that processes that row. But how to

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let's break this down step by step.

First, understanding the problem: The input is a 2D tensor with dimensions M (rows) and N (columns). The task is to compute the maximum value along the last dimension, which means for each row (since the last dimension is N), we take the maximum of all elements in that row. So the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the max of the corresponding row in the input.

Now, thinking about how to implement this in Triton. Triton kernels are written in a way that's similar to CUDA kernels, using threads, blocks, and memory accesses. The key is to figure out how to process each row efficiently.

First, the input tensor is 2D. Each thread needs to process elements in a row. So, for each row (i), we need to find the maximum value among all elements in that row (columns 0 to N-1).

So, the steps for each thread:

1. For a given row index i, the thread needs to process all elements in that row.
2. But how to divide the work among threads? Since each row is independent, we can have each thread handle a portion of the row. However, since the maximum operation is not associative, we need to handle it carefully. Wait, but for a single row, the maximum can be computed by each thread taking a portion of the elements and then combining them.

Wait, but in Triton, each thread can process a single element. But for a row of N elements, if we have multiple threads per row, each thread can take a subset of the elements. However, since the maximum is a reduction, we need to perform a reduction across the elements in the row.

But how to structure this. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The input is a 2D tensor, and the output is a 1D tensor of size M.

So, the kernel should process each row. For each row, we need to compute the max of N elements.

In Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows. For each row, we need to process all elements in that row.

But how to handle the threads. Let's think about the thread index. Each thread can be assigned to a row. For example, if there are M rows, then each thread can handle one row. But if there are more threads than rows, we need to have some way to handle that. Alternatively, we can have each thread handle a single element in the row, but that would require more threads.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, if we have multiple threads per row, each thread can take a portion of the elements. For example, if we have a block size of 128, then each block can process 128 elements per row. But since each row has N elements, we need to make sure that the block size is a divisor of N, or handle the remainder.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction across the threads in the block. That's a common approach for reduction operations.

So, here's the plan:

- Each thread is assigned to a row i. The row index can be determined by the thread index in the block. For example, if the block is processing row i, then the thread index in the block is j, and the element in the row is at column j. But that's only if the block is handling a single row. However, this might not be efficient if the row is longer than the block size.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. Then, for each row, we perform a reduction across all elements in that row.

But how to organize this. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The input tensor is of shape [M, N], and the output is of shape [M]. So, the kernel needs to process each row.

So, the kernel would have a loop over the rows. For each row, we need to compute the maximum of N elements.

In Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows. For each row, the threads in the block process the elements in that row.

But how to divide the work. Let's assume that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. Then, for a row with N elements, the number of threads per row is N. But if N is large, this could be a lot of threads. However, Triton is designed for this kind of scenario.

Alternatively, we can use a block size that allows for a reduction. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block

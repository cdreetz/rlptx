Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works. The result should be a tensor of shape [M, N], where each element is the sum of the products of elements from the first matrix's row and the second matrix's column.

First, I should figure out the GPU operations needed. Matrix multiplication involves a lot of element-wise multiplications and additions. Since Triton is a GPU programming language, I need to use shared memory to optimize memory access, as global memory is slow. So, I'll need to load the first matrix (A) into shared memory, then the second matrix (B) into shared memory as well. Then, for each element in the resulting matrix, I'll compute the sum of the products of corresponding elements from A's row and B's column.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The first matrix A is [M, K], and the second matrix B is [K, N]. The output matrix C will be [M, N]. So, each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

Now, considering the block sizes. Triton kernels typically use a block size that's a multiple of 32, but for matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size of 32 or 64. Let me think about how to partition the matrices. Each block can handle a certain number of rows and columns. For example, if the block size is 32, each thread can handle a portion of the K dimension. Wait, but in matrix multiplication, each thread usually handles one element of the result, but that's not efficient. Instead, we can use a block that processes multiple elements. Alternatively, using a tile-based approach where each block processes a tile of the matrices.

Wait, in standard matrix multiplication, each thread computes one element of the result. But that's not efficient because it leads to many memory accesses. So, a better approach is to use shared memory to store tiles of the matrices. For example, each block can process a tile of size (block_size, block_size), where block_size is 32. So, for the first matrix A, each block will load a tile of size (block_size, block_size), and similarly for B. Then, each thread in the block computes a part of the result.

But how does this fit with the given matrix dimensions? Let me think. The first matrix A is [M, K], and the second is [K, N]. The block size for the K dimension would be the number of elements each thread processes. So, for each block, we can have multiple threads that compute different elements of the result. Wait, perhaps I should structure the kernel such that each thread computes a single element of the result matrix. But that would require that each thread has access to the corresponding elements in A and B.

Alternatively, using a more efficient approach where each thread computes a portion of the sum. For example, if the block size is 32, each thread could handle a certain number of elements in the K dimension. But that might complicate the code.

Let me check the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton. Typically, for matrix multiplication, the kernel is structured such that each thread computes one element of the result. The threads are divided into blocks, and each block handles a portion of the matrix. For example, each block processes a row of the first matrix and a column of the second matrix. However, this approach can be slow because each element requires multiple memory accesses. To optimize, we can use shared memory to store tiles of the matrices.

So, the steps would be:

1. Load the first matrix A into shared memory. Each block will load a tile of A, which is of size (block_size, block_size). Similarly for B.

2. For each element in the result matrix C[i][j], compute the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. But how to do this efficiently with shared memory.

Wait, perhaps each thread in the block is responsible for computing one element of the result. For that, the thread index within the block can be used to determine which element of the result it's responsible for. However, that would require that each thread has access to the corresponding elements in A and B. But since A is [M, K], and B is [K, N], each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

So, for each thread, the index i (row in A) and j (column in B) can be determined. Then, the thread would iterate over k from 0 to K-1, multiply A[i][k] and B[k][j], and accumulate the sum. However, this approach would require that

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the operation is matrix multiplication. So the first tensor is A with shape (M, K) and the second is B with shape (K, N). The result should be a tensor C with shape (M, N), where each element C[i,j] is the sum over k of A[i,k] * B[k,j].

Now, considering how Triton works, I need to structure the kernel to handle this efficiently. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows for low-level control, so I need to make sure that the kernel is optimized for memory access and parallelism.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order, which is the default for most GPU frameworks. So for A, each row is contiguous in memory, and similarly for B. The output tensor C will also be in row-major order.

Next, the kernel needs to process elements of C. Each element C[i,j] is computed as the dot product of the i-th row of A and the j-th column of B. But in Triton, it's more efficient to process in blocks where each block handles a certain number of elements.

I remember that in matrix multiplication, a common approach is to use a block size that allows for efficient memory access. For example, using a block size of 128 or 256, which is a power of two, can help with cache coherence and coalesced memory accesses.

So, the plan is to have each thread compute a block of elements in C. Each thread will handle a certain number of rows and columns. Wait, but in matrix multiplication, each thread typically handles one element of C. However, that's not efficient. Instead, we can use a block size that allows for multiple elements to be computed in parallel.

Alternatively, using a block size that allows for each thread to compute a certain number of elements in C. For example, if we have a block size of 128, each thread can compute a certain number of elements in a row or column.

Wait, maybe I should structure the kernel to have each thread handle a certain number of columns in B. Let me think about the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton.

In the standard approach, each thread block handles a portion of the matrix. For example, each thread block computes a block of C, where each thread computes a single element of C. However, this is not efficient because it leads to many memory accesses. Instead, we can use a more efficient approach by using a block size that allows for multiple elements to be computed in parallel.

Alternatively, using a block size that allows for each thread to compute a certain number of elements in a row. For example, if the block size is 128, then each thread can compute a certain number of elements in a row of C. But I need to think about how to structure the indices.

Let me think about the indices. For each element C[i,j], we need to compute the sum over k of A[i,k] * B[k,j]. So for each i and j, we need to iterate over k.

But in Triton, each thread is responsible for a single element of C. However, that's not efficient. Instead, we can use a block size that allows for multiple elements to be computed in parallel.

Wait, perhaps I should structure the kernel such that each thread block handles a certain number of rows in A and columns in B. For example, each thread block handles a block of rows in A and columns in B. But I need to think about the exact structure.

Alternatively, using a block size where each thread computes a certain number of elements in a row. For example, if the block size is 128, then each thread can compute a certain number of elements in a row of C. But I need to think about how to structure the indices.

Alternatively, using a block size that allows for each thread to compute a single element of C. But that's not efficient. However, in Triton, the kernel can be written to handle this, but with proper memory access patterns.

Wait, maybe I should use a block size of 128, and each thread computes a single element of C. Then, for each element, the thread would load A[i,k] and B[k,j], multiply them, and accumulate the sum. However, this would require that the threads in the block can access the required elements in A and B.

But for this to be efficient, the memory access needs to be coalesced. So, for each thread, when computing C[i,j], it needs to access A[i,k] and B[k,j] for all k. But if the threads are processing different k's, then the memory access might not be coalesced.

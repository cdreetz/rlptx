Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two matrices with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The user specified using tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through the steps.

First, I remember that matrix multiplication involves computing each element of the resulting matrix as the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix. Since we're using shared memory, the idea is to load tiles of the input matrices into shared memory to reduce global memory access latency.

The input tensors are A (M x K) and B (K x N). The output is C (M x N). Each element C[i,j] is the sum over k of A[i,k] * B[k,j].

For tile-based computation, I'll need to divide the matrices into blocks (tiles) of size, say, BLOCK_SIZE. The choice of block size is important for memory access efficiency. Typically, BLOCK_SIZE is a power of two, like 16, 32, 64, etc. Let's choose 128 as a common size, but maybe 32 is better for smaller matrices. Wait, but the user didn't specify, so I should pick a standard one. Let me go with 128 for now.

Now, the shared memory for A and B. Each thread in the block will handle a tile. So, for each tile, we need to load a block of A and a block of B into shared memory. The size of the shared memory blocks depends on the tile size. Let's say each tile is of size (BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE). So, for A, each thread will load a block of size (BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE), and similarly for B.

Wait, but the actual tile size depends on the dimensions of the matrices. Let me think again. The matrices A and B are of sizes M x K and K x N. The tile size is determined by the block size. For example, if the block size is 128, then each tile is 128x128. But the actual number of tiles in each matrix depends on the dimensions.

But in the kernel, each thread will handle a specific tile. So, the kernel will be structured such that each thread is responsible for a certain portion of the output matrix.

Wait, maybe I should structure the kernel in terms of the output matrix C. Each thread computes a single element of C. But that's not efficient. Instead, using tile-based computation, each thread block computes a block of C. So, the kernel is organized into thread blocks, each responsible for a tile of C.

Wait, but in matrix multiplication, the standard approach is to have each thread block compute a tile of the output matrix. For example, if the output matrix is M x N, and the tile size is (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), then each thread block computes a tile of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) in C. The threads within the block compute the dot product between a row of A and a column of B, using shared memory.

But how to structure this in Triton?

Alternatively, each thread in the block computes a single element of C. But that's not efficient. So, the standard approach is to have each thread block compute a tile of C. Let me recall the standard Triton matrix multiplication example.

In the standard Triton matrix multiplication, each thread block computes a tile of the output matrix. Each thread in the block is responsible for computing a single element of the output matrix. Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, each thread in the block computes a single element of the output matrix. But that would require a lot of threads. However, with tile-based computation, the idea is to load a tile of A and B into shared memory, then compute the dot product for each element of the output tile.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the kernel as follows: For each tile of the output matrix C, we compute the dot product between rows of A and columns of B. The shared memory is used to store the tiles of A and B. Each thread in the block is responsible for a specific element in the output tile. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, each thread block computes a tile of C, and each thread in the block computes a single element of that tile.

But in the standard approach, each thread block computes a tile of C. The number of threads per block is (BLOCK_SIZE)^2. Each thread computes a single element of the output tile. But that's not efficient. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the approach. Let me think again.

In the standard matrix multiplication, the kernel is structured such that each thread block computes a block of the output matrix. For example, if the output matrix is of size M x N, and the block size is (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), then each thread block computes a (BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE)

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two matrices with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in Triton.

First, the input tensors are A (MxK) and B (KxN). The result is a matrix C (MxN) where each element C[i,j] is the sum of A[i,k] * B[k,j] for all k. 

In Triton, I need to use shared memory to optimize memory access. The idea is to tile the matrices into blocks that fit into shared memory. Let's think about the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a common block size is 128 elements, but I need to decide on the exact dimensions. Let's say each block is of size BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K for matrix A and BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N for matrix B. Wait, maybe I should use a block size that allows for efficient computation. For example, using a block size of 32x32 might be good, but I need to check.

Wait, the standard approach is to use a block size that allows for efficient loading of rows from A and columns from B into shared memory. Let me think about the steps:

1. Each thread in the kernel handles a block of elements in C. For example, a thread might compute a block of size (BLOCK_M x BLOCK_N) in C. But that's not quite right. Actually, in matrix multiplication, each thread usually computes a single element of C, but with tiling, we can compute multiple elements by loading tiles into shared memory.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread computes a block of elements in C. But perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element, but with shared memory for the tiles.

Wait, I think the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton uses a block size of 128 elements, but I need to structure the kernel to handle the tiling. Let me think again.

In matrix multiplication, the key is to load a row of A and a column of B into shared memory, multiply them, and accumulate the result in C. But with tiling, we can load tiles of A and B into shared memory, compute the product, and then write the results back to C.

So, the kernel would have to:

- For each tile of A and B, load them into shared memory.
- Compute the product of the tiles.
- Write the result to the corresponding position in C.

But how to structure this in Triton?

Alternatively, each thread can handle a block of elements in C. For example, each thread is responsible for computing a certain number of elements in C. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, each thread computes a single element of C, but with shared memory for the tiles.

Wait, perhaps the kernel is structured as follows:

Each thread is responsible for computing a single element of C. However, to do this efficiently, we need to load the corresponding row of A and column of B into shared memory. But for large K, this could be inefficient. Hence, tiling is necessary.

So, the kernel would process the matrices in blocks. Let me think about the block dimensions. Let's say that each thread block processes a block of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K) for matrix A and (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N) for matrix B. But I need to make sure that the block size is chosen such that the shared memory is filled efficiently.

Alternatively, the standard approach is to use a block size of 128 elements, with each thread handling a single element. But that might not be the case here. Let me check the standard Triton matrix multiplication example.

In the Triton matrix multiplication example, the kernel is structured with each thread computing a single element of C. The shared memory is used to load the row of A and column of B. However, this approach can be slow for large K because each thread has to load a row of A and a column of B, which may not be efficient.

To optimize, we can use tiling, where we load tiles of A and B into shared memory, compute the product, and then write the results to C. This reduces the number of times we need to load data from global memory.

So, the kernel would have to:

- For each tile of A (of size BLOCK_M x BLOCK_K) and B (BLOCK_K x BLOCK_N), compute the product and store it in C.

But how to structure this in Triton? Each thread block would process a block of rows in A and columns in B. Let's say that each thread block is responsible for computing a block of size (BLOCK_M x BLOCK_N) in C. However, the exact structure depends on the block size.

Alternatively, each thread block handles a block of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K

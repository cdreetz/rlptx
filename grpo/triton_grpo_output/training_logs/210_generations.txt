Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. So, the input is a 2D tensor, and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row in the input.

First, I need to figure out what GPU operations are needed. Since we're dealing with a 2D tensor and reducing along the last dimension (N), each row (of length N) needs to be summed and then divided by N. So, for each row, sum all elements and then divide by N.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The input is [M, N], and the output is [M]. The kernel will process each row independently. So, for each row in the input, we need to compute the sum and then divide by N.

Now, considering the Triton kernel structure. The kernel will have to iterate over each row. Let's think about the block size. Since each row is processed independently, we can have each thread handle a single row. But wait, maybe that's not efficient. Alternatively, we can have each thread handle a single element in the row. But since we need to sum all elements in a row, perhaps each thread can handle a portion of the row. However, for simplicity, maybe each thread can handle one element in the row, and then the threads in a warp can sum their results. But since the row is of length N, and each thread processes one element, the number of threads per row would be N. But if N is large, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can use a block size that allows for better memory access patterns.

Wait, but for a 2D tensor, the memory layout is probably row-major. So, each row is contiguous in memory. So, for a given row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j for j from 0 to N-1.

So, for each row i, we need to sum all elements in that row. Then divide by N. So, the kernel will have to loop over each row, and for each row, loop over each element in the row, sum them, then divide by N.

But how to structure this in Triton. Triton kernels are written with a loop over the grid and blocks. Let's think about the grid. The grid will have M blocks, each handling a row. Each block will process one row. So, the grid size is M, and each block processes one row. Then, within each block, we process the elements of that row.

But how to handle the elements of the row. For each row, the elements are in contiguous memory. So, for a given row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j, where j ranges from 0 to N-1.

So, in the kernel, for each row i, we can compute the sum. Let's think about the thread index. Each thread in the block can handle a single element in the row. But if the block size is larger than N, then some threads might not be used. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread handle a single element, and the block size is N. But that might not be efficient if N is large.

Alternatively, perhaps the block size is set to a value that allows for efficient processing. For example, if the block size is 256, then for each row, we can have multiple threads processing different elements. But the key is to make sure that each element is accessed in a coalesced manner.

Wait, but for each row, the elements are contiguous. So, if we have a block that processes a row, and each thread in the block handles a single element, then the threads can access the elements in order, which is coalesced. So, for a row of N elements, if the block has N threads, each thread can process one element. But if N is larger than the block size, then we need to have multiple blocks per row. Wait, no. Because the grid is M blocks, each block handles one row. So, each block is responsible for one row. Then, within the block, the threads can process the elements of that row.

So, for each block, the threads will process the elements of the row. So, the block size can be set to a value that allows for efficient processing. For example, if the block size is 256, then for each row, the threads can process elements in the row. But how to handle when the row length is not a multiple of the block size.

Alternatively, perhaps the block size is set to a value that allows for each thread to process a single element. For example, if the block size is 256, then for a row of N elements, the number of threads per block is min(2

Okay, let's see. I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. So the input is a 2D tensor, and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row in the input.

First, I need to figure out what GPU operations are needed. The main task is to compute the average of each row. For each row (each M element), I need to sum all the elements in that row and then divide by N. 

Now, considering the input and output shapes. The input is [M, N], and the output is [M]. So for each row i, we sum the elements from column 0 to N-1, then divide by N. 

Next, I need to think about the memory layout. The tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. So for each row i, the elements are at positions i*N to i*N + N - 1.

For the Triton kernel, I need to decide on the block size. Since each row is processed independently, I can have each thread handle a single row. But wait, if the rows are processed in parallel, each thread can handle one row. However, for a 2D tensor, maybe the threads can be arranged in blocks that process multiple elements per row. But since the operation is per row, maybe it's better to have each thread handle one row. Wait, but if the rows are processed in parallel, then each thread can handle one row. However, the number of threads per block would depend on the number of rows. But since M can be large, maybe we need to use a block size that can handle multiple rows. Wait, no, because each row is independent. So maybe each thread handles one row. But how to structure that.

Alternatively, maybe each thread processes a single element in the row. But that might not be efficient. Wait, but for each row, we need to sum all N elements. So for a given row i, each thread could be responsible for a subset of the elements in that row. But how to divide the elements. For example, if we have a block size of 128, then each block can process 128 elements per row. But since each row has N elements, the number of blocks per row would be ceil(N / 128). But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. But that would require each thread to load the element, add it to a sum, and then after all elements are processed, divide by N. But that would require each thread to process all elements in the row, which might not be efficient.

Wait, but for a row, the sum can be computed by having multiple threads working on different elements. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block can process 128 elements in the row. But since each row has N elements, the number of blocks per row would be ceil(N / 128). However, this approach would require that each block processes a portion of the row. But how to handle that in the kernel.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread handles a single row. So for each row i, the thread processes all elements in that row. But then, the number of threads per block would be 1, and the number of blocks would be M. But if M is large, that might not be efficient. However, Triton can handle that.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is launched with a certain number of blocks and threads per block. So if each block processes one row, then the number of blocks would be M, and each block has one thread. But that's not efficient, since each block would have only one thread. So perhaps that's not the best approach.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread processes a single element in the row. For example, for each row i, each thread j in the block handles element j of that row. But then, the number of threads per block would be the number of elements per row, which is N. But that's not feasible for large N.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let's think again. The main operation is to compute the sum of each row. So for each row i, we need to sum all elements in that row. Then divide by N.

So, for each row i, the sum is sum_{j=0}^{N-1} input[i][j]. Then the mean is sum / N.

So, the kernel needs to process each row, sum all elements in that row, and then compute the mean.

So, the steps for the kernel:

1. For each row i in 0 to M-1:

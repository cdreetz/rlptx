Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, the input is a 2D tensor with dimensions M (rows) and N (columns). The task is to compute the maximum value along the last dimension, which means for each row, I need to find the maximum of all elements in that row. So the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the maximum of the corresponding row in the input.

Now, thinking about how to approach this in Triton. Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for GPU parallelism. I need to structure the kernel so that each thread handles a portion of the data efficiently.

Let me consider the memory layout. The input tensor is 2D, so each row is a contiguous block in memory. For each row, I need to iterate through all the elements in that row and find the maximum. So, each thread should be responsible for a single row. But wait, how do I split the work among threads?

If the number of rows M is large, I can have each thread handle one row. But if M is not a multiple of the number of threads, I need to handle that. Alternatively, maybe I can have each thread handle a range of rows, but that might complicate things. Wait, no. Since the reduction is along the last dimension (columns), each row is independent. So, each thread can process a single row.

But how to structure the kernel. Let me think: the kernel will process each row. For each row, the thread needs to iterate through all N elements and find the maximum. However, in Triton, each thread can process a single element, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread handle a block of elements in the row, but that depends on the block size.

Wait, but for a max reduction, each thread can process a certain number of elements in the row. However, since the max is a reduction operation, we need to collect the maximums from different threads and then perform a final reduction. But in this case, since each row is independent, maybe each thread can process a row, and then the maximum of that row is stored in a shared memory or a result buffer.

Wait, but the problem is that for each row, the maximum is computed. So, each thread can be responsible for a single row. For example, if there are M rows, and each thread processes one row, then each thread would iterate through all N elements in that row and compute the maximum. However, this approach might not be efficient because for each row, the thread would have to process N elements, which could be a lot. But given that N is the number of columns, and M is the number of rows, perhaps it's better to have each thread process a row, and for each row, compute the maximum.

But how to structure the kernel. Let me think about the parameters. The input tensor is of shape [M, N], and the output is [M]. So, for each row i, we need to compute the maximum of input[i, 0...N-1].

In Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows. Each thread can be assigned a row index. Then, for that row, iterate over all columns and find the maximum.

But how to handle this in Triton. The kernel will have a loop over the rows. Each thread is responsible for a row. For each row, the thread will iterate through all the elements in that row and find the maximum.

But how to structure the code. Let's outline the steps:

1. Determine the number of rows M. Each thread is responsible for one row. So, the number of threads should be M. But in Triton, the number of threads is determined by the number of blocks and the number of threads per block. So, perhaps we can have a block size that divides M, but that depends on the actual M.

Wait, maybe the kernel is structured as follows: each block processes a certain number of rows. But since the reduction is per row, maybe each block processes a single row. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, each block can process multiple rows, but that would require more complex logic.

Alternatively, since each row is independent, we can have each thread process a single row. So, the number of threads is M. But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows, and each thread is assigned a row index. For example, in the kernel, we can have a loop over the rows, and each thread is responsible for a single row.

But how to handle the loop. Let me think. The kernel is written with a loop over the rows. For each row, the thread processes all elements in that row. But in Trit

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the max reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the maximum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the max of the elements in that row). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the maximum of N elements.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the maximum of the corresponding row.

Memory layout: The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. For each row, we need to process all N elements. The output will be a single value per row.

Optimal block sizes and memory access patterns. Since we're processing each row independently, we can have each thread handle a single row. But wait, maybe it's better to have each thread process a single element in the row. However, for max reduction, it's more efficient to have threads work in a way that they can compute the max in a parallel manner. Wait, but for a row, the max can be computed by each thread handling a portion of the elements. However, since the row is of length N, and we need to find the max, perhaps a block size that can handle the entire row in a way that each thread processes a part of it. But for a 2D tensor, each row is N elements. So if we have a block size that can process N elements, but that's probably not efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread handle a single element, but then we need to perform a reduction across the threads in the block. Wait, but for each row, the threads in the block can compute the max of their assigned elements and then reduce that.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, if we have a block size that can handle the reduction, perhaps we can have each thread process a portion of the row. For example, if the block size is 128, then each thread can process a certain number of elements. But for max reduction, the standard approach is to have each thread handle a subset of the elements and then perform a reduction.

Alternatively, since each row is independent, perhaps we can have each thread handle a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction across the threads in the block. But that might not be efficient for large N. However, for a 2D tensor, each row is N elements, and the kernel needs to process each row. So maybe the approach is to have each thread handle a single element in the row, and then the block reduces across all threads to find the max for that row.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let's think about the kernel parameters. The kernel will need to process each row. So the first thing is to determine the number of rows (M) and the number of elements per row (N). The kernel will iterate over each row, and for each row, compute the max of its elements.

In Triton, each thread is assigned a unique index. So perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single row. Wait, but that's not efficient because if the number of rows is large, each thread would process a single row, but that would require each thread to process N elements. However, for a row of N elements, the max can be computed by having multiple threads in a block process different elements and then reduce.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured with each block handling a single row. So each block is responsible for a single row, and within the block, the threads perform the reduction to find the max of that row.

So, for each row, the block will have multiple threads that process different elements in the row. The block size can be set to a value that allows for efficient reduction. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block can handle a row of N elements, and the threads in the block work together to compute the max.

But how to map the thread index to the elements in the row. Let's think: for a given row, the elements are at positions [row_idx * N + 0, row_idx * N + 1, ..., row_idx * N + N-1]. So for a given thread in the block, we can compute its position in the row. For example, if the block is processing row i, then each thread in the block is responsible for a certain element in the row.

But how to structure the threads in the block. Let's say the block size is 128, and for a row of N elements, the threads in the block will process elements in the row. The first step

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the minimum value in each row of a 2D tensor. So for each row (each row is of length N), we need to find the minimum value. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Now, considering how Triton works, I need to structure the kernel to process the tensor efficiently. Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for GPU parallelism, so I need to make sure that each thread handles a part of the data, and that memory access is coalesced.

Let me think about the input and output. The input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N], and the output is a 1D tensor of shape [M]. Each thread will process one row. So, the number of threads should be equal to M. Each thread will process all elements in its row and find the minimum.

But wait, how to handle the threads? In Triton, each thread is identified by an index. So, for each row i, the thread will process that row. So, the kernel will have a loop over the rows, and for each row, compute the minimum.

But how to structure the kernel? Let's think about the parameters. The kernel needs to take the input tensor, the output tensor, the dimensions M and N. Also, the kernel should be able to handle the case where N is zero, but since the input is [M, N], N must be at least 1.

So, the kernel will have a loop over the rows (i from 0 to M-1). For each row, we need to load all the elements in that row and find the minimum.

But how to do that in Triton? Let's think about the memory layout. The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. For a given row i, the elements are at positions i*N, i*N+1, ..., i*N + N-1.

But in Triton, each thread will process one row. So, for each row i, the thread will iterate over the elements in that row. However, if we have a thread per row, then for each row, we can compute the minimum by iterating through all elements in that row.

But how to do that efficiently? Let's think about the block size. If the block size is 1, then each thread handles one row. But maybe a larger block size could help, but since each row is independent, perhaps a block size of 1 is acceptable. However, in Triton, the block size is usually chosen to be a power of two, but that's not a strict requirement.

Wait, but for each row, the number of elements is N. So, for each row, the thread will process N elements. But if N is large, then the thread will have to do a lot of work. However, since each row is independent, the kernel can process each row in parallel.

So, the kernel will have a loop over the rows, and for each row, a loop over the elements in that row. But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the rows, and for each row, the thread processes the elements.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is structured with a loop over the rows, and for each row, the thread processes the elements. So, the kernel would look like:

@triton.jit
def kernel(...):
    i = ... # row index
    min_val = ... # initialize to infinity
    for j in range(N):
        val = tl.load(input + i*N + j)
        if val < min_val:
            min_val = val
    tl.store(output + i, min_val)

But this would be for each row i. However, this approach would require that each thread processes N elements, which could be inefficient if N is large. But since each row is independent, maybe this is acceptable.

But how to handle the row index? In Triton, the kernel is launched with a certain number of threads, and each thread has a unique index. So, for example, if we launch the kernel with M threads, each thread will handle one row. So, the kernel would have a loop over the rows, and for each row, compute the minimum.

But how to structure the loops? Let me think about the parameters. The kernel needs to take the input tensor, output tensor, M and N. The kernel is written as a function that takes these parameters.

So, the kernel would be:

@triton.jit
def kernel(input, output, M, N, ...):
    i = tl.program_id(0)
    if i

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the minimum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the minimum element). So for each row (each M element), we need to find the minimum of N elements.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Memory layout: The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. The output tensor will be a 1D array where each element corresponds to a row's minimum.

Optimal block sizes and memory access. Since each row has N elements, and we need to process each row, the block size should be chosen such that each thread handles a portion of the row. However, since we need to find the minimum, it's more efficient to have each thread process a single element and compare with the current minimum. But for a row of N elements, if we have multiple threads per row, we can use a reduction approach.

Wait, but for each row, we can have multiple threads working on it. Let's think about the block size. If each block handles one row, then each block would have N elements to process. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, each block could process multiple rows, but since the rows are independent, maybe it's better to have each block handle one row. But how to split the rows among blocks?

Alternatively, since the rows are independent, we can have each thread process a single element in the row and compare to the current minimum. But for that, each thread would need to process a single element, and then perform a reduction across the row.

But for a row of N elements, the number of threads per block would be N. But that's not efficient if N is large. So maybe we need to use a reduction approach where each thread is responsible for a portion of the row, and then perform a reduction.

Alternatively, since the rows are independent, we can have each thread handle a single element in the row, and then perform a reduction across the row. But that would require that each thread is assigned a unique element in the row, and then they compare their value with the current minimum.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let me think about the kernel parameters. The kernel will process each row. So for each row, we need to find the minimum of N elements.

Let me consider the block size. Let's say each block processes one row. So the number of blocks would be M. Each block would process a row of N elements. But how to split the elements in the row among the threads in the block.

Alternatively, each thread in the block can handle a single element in the row. So for a row of N elements, we need N threads. But if N is large, that could be a lot of threads. However, Triton allows for dynamic thread counts. But maybe for a row of N elements, we can have each thread process a single element, then perform a reduction across the threads in the block to find the minimum.

But for that, the block size needs to be at least N. But if N is large, that could be a problem. However, in Triton, the block size is a parameter that can be adjusted. So perhaps we can set the block size to a value that allows for efficient processing. Let me think about the optimal block size.

Alternatively, for each row, we can have a number of threads that can process the elements in the row. Let's say that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. Then, the block size is the number of elements in the row. But that's not feasible if N is large. However, for the purpose of this problem, perhaps we can proceed with that approach.

But maybe a better approach is to use a reduction across the row. For example, each thread is responsible for a group of elements, and then they compare their group's minimum with the current minimum. But that's more complex.

Alternatively, for each row, the kernel can process all elements in the row, and each thread is assigned a single element. Then, the threads perform a reduction to find the minimum.

But how to structure that. Let me think about the code.

The kernel would need to iterate over each row. For each row, we need to process all N elements. So for each row, we can have a number of threads, say, K threads per block. Each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. Then, the threads compare their element with the current minimum.

But how to handle this in Triton. Let

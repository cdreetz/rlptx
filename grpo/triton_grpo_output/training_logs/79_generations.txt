Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through the steps.

First, I remember that matrix multiplication involves multiplying elements of the first matrix with corresponding elements of the second matrix and summing the products. For efficient computation, especially on GPUs, using shared memory and tiling is crucial to reduce memory latency and improve performance.

So, the two input matrices are A (M x K) and B (K x N). The output matrix C will be (M x N). Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

In Triton, I need to structure the kernel to handle this. The key is to use shared memory for the tiles of A and B to avoid repeatedly loading from global memory. The tile size is usually a multiple of the block size, which is typically 32 or 64. Let's say we use a block size of 32. So, each thread block will handle a tile of size (tile_size x tile_size), where tile_size is a multiple of 32.

Wait, but for matrix multiplication, the tile size might be determined by the block size. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread in the block can handle a portion of the tile. But I need to make sure that the tiles fit into the shared memory.

Let me think about the shared memory. Each thread will load a portion of A and B into shared memory. For example, if the tile size is 32, then each thread might be responsible for a 32x32 tile. But since the matrices are of size M x K and K x N, the tile size needs to be chosen such that it fits into the shared memory.

Wait, maybe the tile size is determined by the block size. Let me recall that in standard matrix multiplication with shared memory, each thread block handles a tile of size (tile_size x tile_size). The tile size is usually chosen to be a multiple of the block size. For example, if the block size is 32, then tile_size is 32. But in some cases, it's 16 or 64. However, the exact value depends on the specific implementation.

But in this problem, the user says to use tile-based computation with shared memory. So the kernel needs to process the matrices in tiles, using shared memory for the tiles.

So, the steps for the kernel would be:

1. Each thread block handles a tile of A and a tile of B. The tile size is determined by the block size. Let's say the block size is 32, and the tile size is 32. So each thread block processes a 32x32 tile of A and a 32x32 tile of B.

But wait, the matrices A and B have different dimensions. A is M x K, B is K x N. So, the tile size for A and B must be such that they can be processed in blocks. For example, if the tile size is 32, then each thread block would process a 32x32 tile of A and a 32x32 tile of B. However, the actual dimensions of the matrices might not be multiples of the tile size, so we need to handle that with masking.

But maybe the tile size is determined by the block size. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread in the block can handle a portion of the tile. So, each thread block would process a tile of size (tile_size x tile_size) for A and B. The tile size is usually chosen as the block size, but sometimes it's a multiple of it. Let me think of the standard approach.

In the standard matrix multiplication with shared memory, each thread block handles a tile of size (tile_size x tile_size). The tile_size is usually chosen as the block size. For example, if the block size is 32, then tile_size is 32. Each thread in the block handles a portion of the tile. For example, in the case of A (M x K), each thread would handle a row of A, and each thread in the block would handle a column of B. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, in the standard approach, the threads are arranged in a grid where each thread block processes a tile of A and a tile of B. For example, the block size is 32x32, and each thread in the block is responsible for a specific element in the tile. For the matrix multiplication, each thread would compute a part of the dot product between a row of A and a column of B.

But for this problem, the matrices are A (M x

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The user wants tile-based computation using shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in Triton.

First, the problem is to compute C = A * B, where A is M x K and B is K x N. The result C will be M x N. Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

In Triton, I need to handle this with shared memory to optimize memory access. The key is to split the matrices into tiles that fit into shared memory. Let's think about the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 is common. Let me choose 32 as a block size for this example.

So, each thread will handle a block of size BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE. But since the matrices are M x K and K x N, I need to figure out how to split them into tiles. Let's assume that the tiles are of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). So, for matrix A, each tile is of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), and similarly for B.

Wait, but the actual dimensions might not be multiples of the block size. So I need to handle cases where the dimensions are not perfectly divisible. Also, I need to use shared memory to store the tiles of A and B so that each thread can access them efficiently.

The steps I need to take:

1. Determine the block size. Let's say BLOCK_SIZE = 32. This is a common choice for Triton kernels.

2. For each thread in the block, compute the indices for the tiles of A and B. Each thread will handle a portion of the matrix multiplication.

3. Load the tiles of A and B into shared memory. Since A is M x K and B is K x N, the tiles for A will be of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), and for B, same.

But wait, the tiles for B would be (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), but B is K x N. So each tile of B is (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), but the actual K and N might not be multiples of the block size. So, for each tile, the threads will process a block of elements.

But how to handle the indices? Let's think about the threads in the block. Each thread in the block will compute a certain element of the result matrix. However, in matrix multiplication, each thread is responsible for a block of elements. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the threads processing a block of the result matrix.

Alternatively, in the standard matrix multiplication approach, each thread is responsible for a single element of the result matrix. But that's not efficient. So using tile-based computation, each thread block processes a tile of the result matrix.

Wait, maybe I should structure the kernel such that each thread block handles a tile of A and a tile of B, and computes a tile of C. But given that A is M x K and B is K x N, the tiles would be (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) for A and (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) for B, and the resulting C tile would be (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE).

So, for each thread in the block, the thread will compute a certain element of the C tile. But how to map the thread index to the elements in the tile.

Alternatively, each thread block is responsible for computing a tile of C. The tile of C is of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). Each thread in the block will compute a single element of this tile. However, that's not efficient. Wait, no. In the standard approach, each thread block computes a tile of C, and each thread in the block computes a single element of that tile. But that would require a lot of threads. Alternatively, perhaps each thread block processes a tile of A and a tile of B, and computes a tile of C.

But how to do that. Let's think about the indices. Let me define the tile dimensions as (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). For matrix A, each tile is of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), and for B, same. Then, the resulting tile of C is (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE).

Each thread in the block is responsible for a certain element of the C tile. So, for each thread, the index in the C tile is determined by the thread's index. For example, if the thread index is (tx, ty), then the element in the C tile is (ty, tx) or something like that. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the thread's position within the block.

Alternatively, the threads in the block are arranged in a grid of BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE. Each thread is responsible for computing a certain element of the C

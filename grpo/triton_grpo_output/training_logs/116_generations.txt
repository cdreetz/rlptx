Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is to compute the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. So for each row (each M element), I need to sum all the elements in that row and then divide by N. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M].

Let me consider the GPU operations. Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for parallelism. Each thread will handle a specific element in the output. So, for each row, I need to process all the elements in that row.

The input tensor is 2D, with shape [M, N]. Let's say the input is called input_tensor, and the output is output_tensor. The output will have M elements, each being the mean of the corresponding row.

Now, the kernel needs to process each row. Let me think about the thread indices. In Triton, each thread is identified by a program counter (pid). So, for each thread, I can determine which row it's responsible for. Since each row has N elements, each thread will process one element in the row. Wait, but if I have M rows, and each row has N elements, then the total number of elements is M*N. But the output is M elements. So, each thread should process one element in the row, but the output is per row. Hmm, maybe I need to structure the threads such that each thread is responsible for a row. Wait, no. Because if each row has N elements, then each row's mean requires summing N elements. So, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then we need to accumulate the sum for each row. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a row, and then processes all elements in that row. But that would require each thread to process N elements, which could be inefficient if N is large. Wait, but in Triton, the threads are arranged in blocks. So perhaps the block size is chosen such that each block handles a row. Let me think.

Let me consider the block size. Let's say each block handles one row. So, for each row, the block processes all N elements. But how to do that? The block size would be N, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each block processes a certain number of elements in a row. But perhaps a better approach is to have each thread process one element in the row, and then accumulate the sum for the row. But how to do that in a way that's efficient.

Alternatively, think about the threads as being grouped into blocks, where each block is responsible for a row. So, for each row, the block processes all elements in that row. But that would require that the block size is N, which could be large. However, if N is large, that might not be efficient. But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, it's manageable.

Wait, but the output is M elements. So, each row's mean is one element. So, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single row. Then, for each row, the thread would sum all N elements in that row and then divide by N. But how to do that in Triton.

Wait, but in Triton, each thread is a single thread. So, if I have M rows, then each thread is assigned a row index. Then, for each row, the thread would process all N elements in that row. But that would require that the thread has access to all N elements in the row. However, in Triton, each thread can process a single element in the row. So, perhaps the approach is to have each thread process one element in the row, and then accumulate the sum for the row.

But that would require that each thread is part of a block that is responsible for a row. For example, if the block size is N, then each block handles a row. But that's not possible if N is large, but perhaps for this problem, we can proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the block size is set to a value that allows each thread to process one element in the row, and then the block can accumulate the sum for the row. But how to do that.

Let me think about the steps:

For each row i in 0 to M-1:

   sum = 0

   for each column j in 0 to N-1:

       sum += input_tensor[i][j]

   output_tensor[i] = sum / N

So, the kernel needs to perform this for each row.

In Triton, the threads are arranged in blocks. Each thread has a program counter (pid), which is the index of the thread in the block. So, for each row, we can have a block that

Okay, let's see. The user wants a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. So, the input is a 2D tensor, and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row in the input.

First, I need to figure out what GPU operations are needed. Since we're dealing with a 2D tensor, each row (of length N) needs to be summed and then divided by N. So, for each row, sum all elements and then divide by N.

Now, the input tensor is [M, N], and the output is [M]. So, each row in the input corresponds to one element in the output. The kernel needs to process each row, sum its elements, and then divide by N.

Next, the memory layout. The input tensor is stored in row-major order, which is standard for most GPU tensors. So, each row is contiguous in memory. For each row, we need to load all N elements and sum them.

For the Triton kernel, I need to decide on the block size. Since each row is processed independently, each thread can handle one row. But wait, if the rows are processed in parallel, maybe each thread can handle a single row. However, if the number of rows is large, maybe we can have multiple threads per row. But for simplicity, maybe each thread handles one row. But wait, if the number of rows is M, then the number of threads needed is M. But Triton kernels can have multiple threads per block. Let me think about the block size.

Alternatively, maybe each thread processes a single element in the row. But that would require more threads. Wait, no. For each row, we need to sum N elements. So, if each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, then each row would have N threads. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each block processes a single row, and each thread within the block handles a portion of the row. But how?

Alternatively, for each row, we can have multiple threads working on that row. For example, if the block size is 128, and each block handles one row, then each block would have 128 threads, each processing a part of the row. But that depends on the number of elements per row. For example, if N is 1024, then each block could process 128 elements, but that would require multiple blocks per row. Wait, but the rows are of length N. So, for each row, the number of elements is N, and each thread can process a certain number of elements. But how to structure that.

Alternatively, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. So, for each row, each thread loads one element and adds it to a sum. But that would require N threads per row, which could be a lot. However, if the number of rows is M, then the total number of threads would be M*N, which could be too large. But Triton can handle that as long as the number of threads is manageable.

But maybe there's a better way. Let's think about the kernel's structure. The kernel should process each row. So, for each row, we need to sum all elements. So, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread processes a single row. Then, for each row, the thread would load all N elements and sum them. But that would require that each thread can process the entire row. However, if N is large, then each thread would need to process a lot of elements, which might be inefficient.

Alternatively, perhaps we can split the row into chunks. For example, each thread handles a chunk of the row. But how to do that in Triton.

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured with each thread handling a single element in the row. For example, for each row, the thread index within the block can be used to determine which element in the row it's responsible for. But that would require that the block size is compatible with the number of elements per row.

Wait, but the problem is that for each row, the number of elements is N. So, if the block size is 128, and N is 1024, then each block can process 128 elements of the row. But how to handle that. But the kernel is supposed to process each row. So, maybe the kernel is designed to process each row in parallel. So, for each row, the threads in the block process a part of the row.

But perhaps it's easier to have each thread handle a single element in the row. So, for each row, the thread index in the block (say, 0 to 127) corresponds to the element index in the row. But that

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to compute the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. So for each row (each M element), I need to sum all the elements in that row and then divide by N. Since it's a mean, I have to handle the case where N is zero, but since the input is [M, N], I assume N is at least 1. But maybe I should include a check for that, though the problem statement doesn't mention it. The user might expect that N is positive.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row. So for each row i, output[i] = sum(input[i, :]) / N.

Now, the kernel needs to process each row. So the kernel should iterate over each row, and for each row, compute the sum of all elements in that row. Then, divide by N. But how to structure this in Triton?

In Triton, I'll need to use threads per block. Let's think about the block size. Since each row is processed independently, each block can handle one row. So each block will process one row. So the number of blocks would be M, and each block processes one row.

But wait, how to handle the threads within a block. For each row, we need to sum all N elements. So for each row, we can have multiple threads working on different elements of the row. But since the row is of size N, we can have multiple threads per block, each handling a portion of the row.

Alternatively, maybe each thread handles one element in the row. But that would require N threads per block, which might not be efficient if N is large. However, Triton's block size is usually set to a power of two, like 256. So perhaps we can set the block size to 256, and for each row, each thread computes a part of the sum.

But for a row of size N, if N is less than the block size, then each thread would handle one element. But if N is larger, we need to have multiple threads per block, each handling a part of the row. So the block size can be set to 256, and each thread would handle a certain number of elements in the row.

Wait, but the sum can be done in a reduction. So for each row, the threads in the block can compute partial sums and then reduce them. So for a row of N elements, each thread would take a chunk of elements, sum them, and then reduce across the threads.

But how to map the row elements to the threads. Let me think: for each row, the elements are in the input tensor. So for a given row i, the elements are input[i, 0], input[i, 1], ..., input[i, N-1].

Each thread in the block would process a certain number of elements. Let's say the block size is 256. So for a row of N elements, each thread would process a certain number of elements. But since N can vary, perhaps we can use a dynamic approach.

Alternatively, for each row, we can compute the sum by having each thread in the block take a portion of the row. But how to handle that.

Alternatively, maybe the block processes the entire row, and each thread handles one element. But if N is large, that would require many threads per block. However, the block size is fixed, so for N larger than the block size, we need to have multiple threads per block. But perhaps the block size can be set to 256, and each thread handles one element. So for each row, the threads in the block would process each element in the row, and then perform a reduction to get the sum.

Wait, but if the block size is 256, and N is 256, then each thread can handle one element. But if N is 512, then each thread would handle one element, but the block would have 256 threads, so each thread would handle two elements? No, that's not right. Wait, the block size is 256, so each block can have up to 256 threads. So for a row of N elements, each thread in the block would process a certain number of elements. But how to do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread handles a single element in the row. For each row, the threads in the block would process the elements in that row. But if N is larger

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to compute the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. So for each row (each M element), I need to sum all the elements in that row and then divide by N. Since it's a mean, I have to handle the division properly, maybe using integer division if the data is integers, but the problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume it's a general case.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

Memory layout: The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. For the kernel, each thread will process one row. So the threads should be grouped by row. Each thread will handle one row, summing all elements in that row.

Block size: Since each thread handles a row, the block size should be set to 1, but maybe using a larger block size if there's a way to process multiple rows. Wait, no, since each row is independent, each thread can handle one row. But in Triton, threads are grouped into warps, and blocks are processed in parallel. So maybe the block size is set to 1, and each thread processes one row. But how to handle the row indices?

Wait, perhaps the kernel is designed such that each thread processes one element in a row. Wait, no, that would be for a different operation. Wait, no, for the mean, each thread would need to sum all elements in a row. But if the row has N elements, then each thread would need to process a portion of the row. But if N is large, then perhaps we can split the row into chunks. But since the kernel is for a 2D tensor, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread handles a single row, and then sums all elements in that row.

Alternatively, maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then the threads in the block sum their elements. But that would require more complex handling. Let's think.

Let me think about the kernel structure. The input is a 2D tensor, say input of shape [M, N]. The output is [M]. Each row is of length N.

So, for each row i in 0..M-1, compute the sum of input[i, 0..N-1], then divide by N.

In Triton, each thread can be assigned to a specific row. So the kernel will have a loop over the rows. Each thread will process one row. But how to handle the elements in that row?

If the kernel is written with a loop over the rows, then each thread would process one row. For each row, the thread would need to load all N elements and sum them. But if N is large, this could be inefficient. However, for a 2D tensor, each row is contiguous in memory, so perhaps we can process the row in a way that each thread loads elements in a stride.

Wait, but if each thread is responsible for a single row, then for that row, the thread would need to sum all N elements. But if N is large, then the thread would have to loop through all N elements. However, in Triton, each thread can have a loop over the elements of the row. But that would require the thread to process each element in the row, which could be slow for large N.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a block-based approach where each block handles a row. For example, each block processes one row, and the threads in the block work together to sum the elements of that row. But that would require more complex code.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is written such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row, and then the threads in the block sum their elements. But that would require the block to have multiple threads, each handling a part of the row. For example, if the block has 32 threads, and the row has N elements, then each thread would handle N/32 elements. But this would require that N is a multiple of the block size, which may not be the case. Also, this approach would require more complex code for handling the sum.

But given that the problem is to compute the mean along the last dimension, perhaps the most straightforward way is to have each thread handle one row, and then sum all elements in that row. However, for large N, this would be inefficient. But maybe for the purposes of this problem, we can proceed with that approach.

So, the kernel would have:

- Each thread is assigned a row index

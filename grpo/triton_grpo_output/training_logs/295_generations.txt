Okay, let's tackle this Triton kernel for matrix multiplication. The user wants to multiply two matrices: one of shape [M, K] and another of shape [K, N]. The result should be a matrix of shape [M, N]. 

First, I need to recall how matrix multiplication works. Each element in the resulting matrix is the sum of the products of elements from the corresponding row of the first matrix and column of the second matrix. So for each element (i, j) in the result, it's the sum over k from 0 to K-1 of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

Now, considering Triton's capabilities. Triton is a high-performance GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA but with more flexibility. The key is to structure the kernel to efficiently use the GPU's resources, like memory access patterns and thread blocks.

I need to decide on the thread block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 128 or 256 is common. Let's go with 128 for this case. But I should check if that's suitable for the problem. Each thread block will handle a portion of the matrices. 

Next, the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. So for A, each row is contiguous in memory. Similarly for B. The output tensor C will be stored in row-major as well. 

Each thread in the block will compute one element of the result. But since K can be large, we need to make sure that the inner loop (over k) is efficient. However, in Triton, each thread can handle one element, so the loop over k is the inner loop. 

Wait, but for matrix multiplication, the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element. However, with large K, this could be slow. But given that Triton is optimized for this, maybe it's manageable. 

So, the kernel will have threads that iterate over the rows of A and columns of B. Each thread computes one element of C. 

But how to structure the threads. Let's think: each thread block will handle a certain number of rows in A and columns in B. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block can handle 128 rows of A and 128 columns of B. But that depends on the matrix dimensions. 

Alternatively, each thread can be responsible for a single element of C. So, the thread index in the block can be used to determine which element of C it's responsible for. 

But how to map the thread indices to the elements. Let's say the thread index in the block is i. Then, the row of A is i, and the column of B is j. Wait, no. Because each thread would compute C[i][j], so the thread's position in the block would correspond to the row and column of C. 

But for that, the block needs to be divided into threads that can compute different (i,j) pairs. However, with a block size of 128, each thread can compute one element. So, for each thread, we have i = thread_idx in the block, and j = ...? Wait, maybe that's not the right way. 

Alternatively, each thread block is responsible for a block of rows in A and columns in B. For example, if the block size is 128, then each thread in the block can compute a certain number of elements. But I think the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element. 

So, the kernel will have threads that iterate over the rows of A and columns of B. Each thread will compute one element of C. 

But how to handle the indices. Let's think: For each thread, the row index in A is i, and the column index in B is j. Then, the element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. 

But in Triton, each thread can be assigned a unique (i,j) pair. However, for a matrix multiplication, the number of threads needed is M*N, which can be very large. So, the kernel needs to be structured so that each thread is responsible for one element of C. 

But how to map the thread index to i and j. Let's say that the kernel is launched with a grid of (num_rows, num_cols), where each block handles one row of A and one column of B. Wait, but that's not quite right. 

Alternatively, the kernel is launched with a grid of (M, N), and each block is responsible for one element of C. But that would require a very large number of blocks, which might not be efficient. 

Alternatively, the kernel is structured so that each thread block handles a block of rows and columns. For example,

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, the matrices are A (MxK) and B (KxN). The result should be C (MxN), where each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k from 0 to K-1. 

So, the kernel needs to compute this efficiently on the GPU using Triton. Let me think about how to structure the kernel.

In Triton, each thread typically handles a single element of the output matrix. But since matrix multiplication is compute-intensive, I need to optimize memory access patterns. The key here is to use proper blocking and ensure that each thread can access elements in a coalesced manner.

Let me recall that in matrix multiplication, the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element of the result. However, for efficiency, it's better to use a block size that allows for efficient memory access. For example, using a block size of 16 or 32 might be good, but I need to think about the specific dimensions here.

Wait, the problem is that for each element C[i][j], we need to sum over K elements. If K is large, this could be a problem. But Triton allows for efficient computation if the threads can handle the inner loop efficiently.

Let me consider the memory layout. The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. So, for A, each row is contiguous in memory, and similarly for B. For the output C, each row is contiguous.

But in the kernel, each thread will compute one element of C. So, for each thread, the indices would be i (row of C), j (column of C), and k (the inner dimension). But how to map these to the thread index?

Alternatively, maybe I can use a block size that allows for multiple elements to be computed in parallel. But given that the problem is to compute each element of C, perhaps the standard approach is to have each thread compute one element.

Wait, but in Triton, each thread is a warp, and each warp can have multiple threads. So, maybe I need to structure the kernel so that each thread handles a single element of C, and the threads are arranged in a way that allows for efficient memory access.

So, the kernel should have a loop over i (rows of C), then j (columns of C), then k (the inner dimension). But how to map this to the thread indices?

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured with each thread handling a single element of C. So, for each thread, the indices i, j, and k are determined by the thread's position in the grid and the block size.

But how to compute i, j, and k for each thread? Let me think. Let's say the kernel is launched with a grid of (M, N) threads. Each thread is responsible for computing C[i][j]. Then, for each thread, the k index would be the inner loop variable. But that's not efficient because for each thread, the k loop would have to iterate K times, which could be slow if K is large.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is written in a way that each thread is responsible for a single element of the result. So, the kernel would have to loop over i and j, and for each, loop over k. But that's not efficient for large K. So, perhaps the kernel needs to be optimized for the inner loop, using a block size that allows for efficient computation of the sum over k.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel can be structured to compute multiple elements of C in parallel. But that might complicate the code.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured to compute each element of C by iterating over k, but using a block size that allows for efficient memory access. For example, using a block size of 16, and each thread handles a certain k.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the standard Triton matrix multiplication kernel. Let me recall that in Triton, the standard approach is to have each thread compute a single element of C, and the threads are arranged in a grid that covers all i and j. Then, for each thread, the inner loop over k is handled by the thread's index.

But for large K, this could be slow. However, the problem here is that the user is asking for a kernel that can handle this, so I need to proceed with that approach.

So, the kernel will have a loop over i (rows of C), then j (columns of C), then k (the inner dimension). But how to structure this in Triton.

Wait, in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the grid, and each thread is responsible for a particular i and j. Then

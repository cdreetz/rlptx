Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that matrix multiplication involves computing each element of the resulting matrix as the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix. But since we're using shared memory, we need to tile the matrices to optimize memory access. The key here is to load chunks of data into shared memory and reuse them, which reduces the number of times we have to fetch data from global memory.

So the input tensors are A (M, K) and B (K, N). The output tensor C will be (M, N). Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

For tile-based computation, I'll need to divide the matrices into tiles. Let's assume that each tile is of size TILE_M x TILE_K for matrix A and TILE_K x TILE_N for matrix B. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of blocks. Each block (tile) of A will be loaded into shared memory, and similarly for B. Then, for each block, we compute the dot product between the corresponding rows of A and columns of B.

But how to structure the kernel? The kernel will have to iterate over the rows of A and columns of B. However, since we're using shared memory, the kernel needs to process elements in a way that maximizes coalesced memory access.

Let me think about the layout. The kernel will have threads that process elements of C. Each thread might be responsible for a particular element in C. But with shared memory, we need to organize the data so that each thread can access the necessary elements from A and B.

Wait, maybe the approach is to have each thread block handle a block of A and B. For example, each thread block handles a tile of A (size TILE_M x TILE_K) and a tile of B (size TILE_K x TILE_N). Then, the threads within the block compute the dot product for each element in the resulting tile of C.

But how to split the work? Let me think. The kernel will have to iterate over the rows of A and columns of B. Each thread in the block will compute a part of the result. Alternatively, maybe each thread block handles a block of C, and computes the corresponding elements.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread block processes a block of A and B. For example, if the kernel is for the entire matrix multiplication, each thread block handles a tile of A and a tile of B, and computes the corresponding tile of C.

But I need to make sure that the shared memory is used efficiently. Let me recall that in Triton, shared memory is accessed via the `shared` keyword. So, for matrix A, each thread block will load a tile of size TILE_M x TILE_K into shared memory. Similarly for matrix B, a tile of size TILE_K x TILE_N.

But wait, the dimensions of the matrices might not be multiples of the tile size. So, I need to handle cases where the matrices are not perfectly divisible by the tile size. That requires some masking or handling of the remaining elements.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the tile sizes. Let's choose TILE_M = 32, TILE_K = 32, and TILE_N = 32. These are common choices for tile sizes in matrix multiplication, but they can be adjusted based on the specific hardware and data sizes.

2. For each thread block, compute the starting row and column in the matrices A and B that this block is responsible for. For example, the block will handle rows i to i + TILE_M - 1 in A, and columns j to j + TILE_N - 1 in B. Wait, but the tile size for B is TILE_K x TILE_N. Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust the tile sizes for A and B to fit the dimensions.

Wait, the matrices A is M x K, and B is K x N. So, the tile size for A should be TILE_M x TILE_K, and for B, TILE_K x TILE_N. Then, each block will process a tile of A and a tile of B, and compute the corresponding tile of C.

But how to compute the indices for the blocks? Let's say that the kernel is responsible for computing the entire matrix C. The kernel will have to iterate over the blocks of A and B. For each block, we compute the corresponding block in C.

But in Triton, the kernel is usually written with a loop over the rows and columns, and each thread computes a specific element. However, with shared memory, we need to load tiles into shared memory and compute the dot product.

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured to process each element

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The user mentioned using tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through the steps.

First, the matrix multiplication operation. The first matrix is MxK, the second is KxN. The result should be MxN. Each element in the result is the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix. 

For Triton, I need to handle this efficiently. Since it's tile-based, I'll use shared memory to store tiles of the input matrices. The idea is to split the matrices into smaller blocks (tiles) that fit into shared memory, which is faster than accessing global memory.

So, the plan is to divide the matrices into tiles of size, say, TILE_M x TILE_K for the first matrix and TILE_K x TILE_N for the second. Wait, but the second matrix is KxN. So maybe the tiles are TILE_K x TILE_N? Or maybe TILE_K for the rows and TILE_N for the columns? Hmm, I need to think about how to structure the tiles.

Let me recall that in standard matrix multiplication, each element in the output is computed as the sum of products of elements from the first matrix's row and the second matrix's column. So, for each element (i, j) in the output, we compute sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

In Triton, the kernel will process elements in blocks. The key is to compute the dot product of a row from A and a column from B, but using shared memory to store the tiles.

So, the steps would be:

1. Load the first matrix (A) into shared memory in tiles. Each tile is of size TILE_M x TILE_K. For each row in A, we load a tile of TILE_K elements. Similarly, for the second matrix (B), each tile is TILE_K x TILE_N, so that when we compute the dot product, we can have the necessary elements in shared memory.

Wait, maybe the tiles for B should be TILE_K x TILE_N. So that when we process a row from A (which is TILE_M elements), we can multiply it with a column from B (which is TILE_N elements), but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the tiles are structured such that for each row in A, we have a tile of TILE_K elements, and for each column in B, we have a tile of TILE_K elements. Then, the dot product can be computed by multiplying the elements from the row tile and column tile.

Alternatively, maybe the tiles are arranged so that each tile of A is TILE_M x TILE_K, and each tile of B is TILE_K x TILE_N. Then, when we process a block of rows from A and columns from B, we can compute the dot product for each element in the output.

But how to structure the shared memory. Let me think of the shared memory as a cache for the tiles. For each block of rows in A, we load a tile of size TILE_M x TILE_K into shared memory. Similarly, for each block of columns in B, we load a tile of size TILE_K x TILE_N into shared memory. Then, for each element in the output, we compute the dot product between the corresponding row in A's tile and column in B's tile.

But how to manage the indices. Let me think of the kernel as processing elements in blocks. For each block of rows in A (say, starting at row i) and columns in B (starting at column j), we compute the corresponding elements in the output matrix.

Wait, maybe the kernel is structured as follows: for each element in the output matrix, we compute the dot product of the corresponding row from A and column from B. But with tile-based computation, we process multiple elements at once.

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured to process a block of rows from A and a block of columns from B, and compute the dot product for each element in the output block.

But I need to make sure that the shared memory is used efficiently. So, for each row in A, we load a tile of TILE_K elements into shared memory. Then, for each column in B, we load a tile of TILE_K elements into shared memory. Then, the dot product is computed between the row tile and column tile.

But the problem is that the second matrix B is KxN, so each column is of length K. So, for a given column in B, the elements are in a column of length K. So, if we load a tile of B's columns, perhaps we need to transpose it so that each column is a row in shared memory.

Alternatively, maybe for B, we transpose it in shared memory so that each row in B's shared memory is a column in the original B. That way, when we compute the dot product

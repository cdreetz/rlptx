Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in the context of GPU kernels, especially with Triton.

First, the problem is to compute C = A * B, where A is MxK and B is KxN. The result C will be MxN. The standard approach for matrix multiplication on GPUs is to use shared memory to store tiles of the matrices, which reduces memory bandwidth usage and allows for efficient computation.

So, the steps I need to take are:

1. **Understand the operations needed**: Each element C[i][j] is the sum of A[i][k] * B[k][j] for all k in 0..K-1. But with tile-based computation, we'll process smaller blocks (tiles) of the matrices.

2. **Determine the input/output tensor shapes and memory layout**: The input tensors A and B are stored in row-major order. The output tensor C will be stored in row-major as well. The kernel will need to process each element of C by computing the dot product of the corresponding rows of A and columns of B.

3. **Optimal block sizes and memory access patterns**: For shared memory, the block size (number of elements per thread) should be chosen to maximize memory bandwidth. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 16x16 or 32x32 is used. However, the exact size depends on the problem size and the hardware. Let's assume a block size of 16x16 for the tiles. Each thread will handle a small tile of A and B, and compute the dot product for a small block of C.

4. **Handling edge cases with masking**: If the matrices are not multiples of the tile size, there might be leftover elements. The kernel should handle these by checking if the indices are within bounds and using masks to avoid out-of-bounds access.

Now, let's think about the structure of the Triton kernel. The kernel will need to:

- Load the tiles of A and B into shared memory.
- Compute the dot product for each element in the output tile.
- Store the result in the output tensor.

But wait, the problem says to use tile-based computation with shared memory. So, each thread will be responsible for a small block of the output matrix. Let me think about the thread layout.

In Triton, each thread is assigned a unique (i, j) position in the output matrix. For each thread, it needs to compute the dot product of the corresponding row in A and column in B. However, to do this efficiently, we can use shared memory to store tiles of A and B.

Let me outline the steps for the kernel:

- The kernel is launched with grid dimensions that cover all elements of the output matrix. Each thread is responsible for computing one element of C.
- For each thread, the thread index (i, j) corresponds to the position in C.
- The thread will compute the dot product of A's row i and B's column j.
- To do this efficiently, we can use shared memory to store tiles of A and B. The tiles are of size (tile_m, tile_k) for A and (tile_k, tile_n) for B. But wait, the tile size for A and B depends on how we split the matrices into tiles.

Alternatively, for each thread, we can compute the dot product by iterating over the K elements. But that would be O(K) per thread, which is not efficient. So, the tile-based approach is better. The idea is to split the matrices into tiles of size (tile_m, tile_k) for A and (tile_k, tile_n) for B, and compute the dot product for each tile.

Wait, but in the case of matrix multiplication, the standard approach is to split the matrices into tiles, and each tile is processed by a block of threads. However, in the case of Triton, where each thread is a single thread, perhaps the tile-based approach is to process a small block of elements in the output matrix.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed such that each thread handles a small block of the output matrix, and uses shared memory to store the relevant parts of A and B.

But I need to think about the exact structure. Let me recall that in matrix multiplication with shared memory, each thread is responsible for a small block of the output matrix. For example, if the tile size is (tile_m, tile_n), then each thread computes a single element of the output matrix. However, to compute that element, the thread needs to compute the dot product of the corresponding row of A and column of B.

But if the tile size is larger, then the threads can process multiple elements in parallel. However, in this case, the problem

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should recall how matrix multiplication works. The standard approach is to compute each element of the resulting matrix as the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix. But with large matrices, doing this naively would be too slow. So, using tile-based computation with shared memory is the way to go. This involves breaking the matrices into smaller tiles that can be stored in shared memory, which is faster than global memory.

The input tensors are A (M, K) and B (K, N). The output tensor C (M, N) will be the result. Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

In Triton, I need to structure the kernel to handle this efficiently. Let's think about the blocks. Each block will process a tile of A and B. The block size is typically chosen based on the available shared memory. For example, a common block size is 128 elements, but I need to adjust based on the data types and the number of elements that can fit in shared memory.

Shared memory is used to store the tiles of A and B. So, each thread in the block will handle a part of the tile. The key is to make sure that each thread accesses elements in a way that maximizes coalesced memory access.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the block size. Let's say each block processes a tile of size (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K) for matrix A and (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N) for matrix B. But wait, the tile size for A and B should be such that they fit into shared memory. For example, if the block size is 128, then the tile size for A might be 16x16, but that depends on the data types.

2. The kernel will iterate over the rows of A and columns of B. Each thread will compute a part of the result. But since we're using shared memory, the threads need to load their respective tiles into shared memory and then perform the multiplication.

3. The kernel will have to handle the indices correctly. For each thread, we need to compute which element of the tile it's responsible for. Also, we need to handle the case where the tile doesn't fit into the matrix dimensions, using masking to ignore out-of-bounds accesses.

Let me think about the parameters. The kernel will need to know the dimensions M, K, N. Also, the stride of the input tensors. For example, A is a 2D tensor with strides (K, 1), and B is (N, K) with strides (K, 1). Wait, no, the strides depend on how the tensor is stored. For a tensor with shape [M, K], the stride for rows is K, and for columns is 1. Similarly for B.

In Triton, the kernel will take the input tensors as parameters. The kernel will process each element of C by computing the dot product of a row from A and a column from B.

But with shared memory, each block will load a tile of A and a tile of B into shared memory. Then, each thread in the block will compute a part of the result. For example, if the block size is 128, then each thread might handle a part of the tile.

Wait, maybe the block size is determined by the number of elements that can fit into shared memory. Let's say we have a block size of 128. Then, for each tile, the number of elements in the tile is BLOCK_M * BLOCK_K. But for the matrix multiplication, the tiles should be such that each tile of A is (BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K) and each tile of B is (BLOCK_K, BLOCK_N). But the actual tile size depends on the block size and the number of elements that can fit into shared memory.

Alternatively, perhaps the block size is chosen such that the threads can process the tiles. For example, if we have a block size of 128, then each thread in the block can handle a part of the tile. But I need to structure the code to handle this.

Let me think about the shared memory. Each thread in the block will load a portion of the tile. For example, for matrix A, each thread might be responsible for a certain row and column in the tile. Similarly for matrix B.

But I need to make sure that the threads in the block can compute the dot product correctly. Let's say that each thread in the block is responsible for a particular element in the result. However, that's not efficient because each element in the result requires a dot product over K elements

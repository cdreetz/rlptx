Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the minimum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor). So for each row (each M element), I need to find the minimum of the N elements in that row.

Let me recall how Triton works. Triton kernels are written in a language similar to CUDA, with support for parallelism and memory operations. The kernel will process elements in blocks, and each thread will handle a certain portion of the data.

So, the input tensor is 2D, shape [M, N]. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Now, thinking about the GPU operations. For each row, we need to find the minimum. So, each thread in the block can handle a single element in the row. But how to do this efficiently?

Wait, but in Triton, threads are grouped into blocks. So, perhaps each block processes a single row. Let me think: if the rows are M in number, and each block processes one row, then the number of blocks would be M. But since each block can have multiple threads, maybe we can have each thread process a single element in the row. However, for a row of N elements, if we have N threads per block, that might be efficient. But how to arrange that?

Alternatively, maybe each block handles a single row, and the threads within the block process the elements of that row. For example, if the block size is 128, then each block can handle a row of N elements, but only if N is larger than 128. But if N is smaller than the block size, then the threads would be idle. But that's okay, as Triton can handle that.

Wait, but for each row, we need to find the minimum. So, for a given row, the threads in the block can each take a value from that row and compare them to find the minimum.

But how to do that? Let me think of the steps:

1. For each row (i), we need to process all elements in that row (columns j from 0 to N-1).
2. Each thread in the block can handle a single element in the row.
3. The threads need to compare their value with the current minimum and update it if necessary.

But how to do this in a way that's efficient in Triton. Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensor is stored as a 2D array, so each row is contiguous in memory. So, for a given row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j, where j is the column index.

So, for a given thread in the block, it can compute its position in the row. Let's say the block is responsible for row i. Then, each thread in the block can handle a column j in that row.

But how to arrange the threads in the block. Let's say the block has a size of 128. For a row with N elements, each thread in the block would process a single element. So, the threads would iterate over the elements of the row.

But to find the minimum, we need to have all threads in the block compare their values and find the minimum. So, this is similar to a parallel reduction. However, since each thread is processing a single element, perhaps we can use a reduction approach where each thread starts with its value, and then compares with others.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, if we have N threads, each thread can take one element and then compare with others. However, in a reduction, you need to have a way to accumulate the minimum. So, perhaps the threads can perform a reduction across the elements of the row.

But how to do that in Triton. Let's think of the steps for a single row:

- Each thread in the block is assigned a column index j in the row.
- The thread loads the value from the input tensor at (i, j).
- Then, the threads perform a reduction to find the minimum.

But how to do that. For example, in a reduction, you can have each thread compare with another thread's value and pass the minimum. But for a row of N elements, the number of threads in the block may be less than N. So, perhaps the block is responsible for processing a row, and the threads in the block are responsible for processing the elements of that row.

Wait, but if the block size is larger than N, then some threads in the block would be idle. But that's okay. Alternatively, the block size can be set to the number of elements in the row, but that's not feasible for varying N

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the minimum value in each row of a 2D tensor. Since the tensor is [M, N], each row has N elements, and we need to compute the min for each of the M rows.

So, the kernel should process each row independently. For each row, we need to iterate through all the elements and find the minimum. But how to structure this in Triton?

Triton kernels are written in a way that uses threads to process elements. The kernel will have a grid of threads, each handling a specific row. Let's think about the thread layout.

Each thread should handle one row. So, the number of threads in the grid should be equal to the number of rows, M. Each thread will process the elements in its assigned row.

Now, for each row, the thread needs to iterate over the elements in that row. The elements are in the last dimension, so for a row i, the elements are at positions (i, j) where j ranges from 0 to N-1.

But how to structure the loop in Triton. Triton uses a loop over the elements, and each thread processes a specific element. Wait, but in this case, each thread is responsible for a row, and then within that row, it needs to find the minimum. So maybe each thread is responsible for a row, and then within that row, it's processing all the elements.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. So perhaps the kernel is structured with a loop over the rows, and then within each row, a loop over the columns. But how to manage that.

Alternatively, since each row is independent, we can have each thread handle a row, and then within that row, process all the elements. But how to do that in Triton.

Wait, maybe the kernel is structured with a grid of threads, each thread handling a row. Then, for each row, the thread needs to iterate through all the elements in that row. But in Triton, each thread has a loop that processes elements in a certain way.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured with a loop over the rows, and then for each row, a loop over the columns. But how to structure that.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensor is 2D, with shape [M, N]. So, the tensor is stored in row-major order. Each row is contiguous in memory.

So, for each row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j, where j is the column index. Wait, no, if it's a 2D tensor, the memory is stored as [M, N], so each row is contiguous. So, for row i, the elements are at i*N to (i+1)*N -1.

But in Triton, the kernel will need to access these elements. So, for a given row i, the thread needs to iterate through all columns j from 0 to N-1, and find the minimum value.

But how to do that in Triton. The kernel will have a loop over the rows, and then for each row, a loop over the columns.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop that is controlled by the thread index. So, perhaps the kernel is structured as follows:

- The grid size is M, so each thread is responsible for a row i.
- For each row i, the thread needs to process all elements in that row.

So, the kernel will have a loop over the rows, and then for each row, a loop over the columns.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let me think of the code structure.

First, the kernel is written with a grid of threads. Each thread is assigned a row index i. Then, for that row, the thread needs to iterate over all columns j from 0 to N-1.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop that is controlled by the thread index. So, perhaps the kernel has a loop over the rows, and then for each row, a loop over the columns.

But how to do that. Let me think of the code.

The kernel would be something like:

@triton.jit
def kernel(input, output, M, N, ...):
    i = ... # thread index for row
    # for each row i, process all columns j
    min_val = input[i, 0]
    for j in range(N):
        val = input[i, j]
        if val < min_val:
            min_val = val
    output[i] = min_val

But how to structure this in Triton. Because Triton requires that the kernel is written with a loop that is controlled by

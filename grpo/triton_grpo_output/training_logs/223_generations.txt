Okay, let's see. The user wants a Triton kernel that computes the mean reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. So, the input is a 2D tensor, and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row in the input.

First, I need to figure out what GPU operations are needed. Since we're dealing with a 2D tensor and computing the mean along the last dimension, each row (which is of length N) needs to be summed and then divided by N. So, the steps are: sum each row, then divide by N.

Now, considering the Triton kernel structure. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA. The kernel will process elements in blocks, so I need to decide on the block size. Since each row is processed independently, perhaps each block can handle one row. But since the rows are of length N, which could be large, maybe we need to process multiple elements per block. Wait, but if the block size is too big, it might not be efficient. Let's think about the block size.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input tensor is [M, N], so each row has N elements. For each row, we need to sum all N elements. The output will be M elements, each being the mean of the row.

So, the kernel needs to process each row. Each thread in a block can handle a portion of the row. But how to organize the threads? Maybe each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. But if the row is long, that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each block handles a single row, and the threads within the block process the elements of that row.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, if we have a block with, say, 128 threads, then each thread can process one element. But if N is large, that could be a lot of threads. Alternatively, maybe the block processes multiple elements in parallel. But since the sum is needed, perhaps each thread can accumulate a part of the sum. However, for a sum, it's easier to have each thread process a single element and then the block sums them all. But that would require that each thread in the block handles one element of the row.

So, the approach would be: for each row, each thread in the block processes one element, adds it to a shared sum, and then the block's sum is computed. Then, after all threads in the block have processed their elements, the block's sum is divided by N to get the mean.

But how to organize this. Let's think about the kernel parameters. The input tensor is [M, N], and the output is [M]. So, each row is processed independently. So, the kernel needs to iterate over each row, and for each row, process all elements.

So, the kernel will have a loop over the rows. For each row, the threads in the block will process the elements of that row. Let's think about the block size. Let's say each block handles one row. Then, the number of blocks is M. But for each row, the number of threads per block would be N. However, if N is large, that's not feasible. So, maybe the block size is smaller, and each block processes a portion of the row.

Alternatively, perhaps each block is responsible for processing a single row, and the threads in the block process the elements of that row. For example, if the block size is 128, then for a row of N elements, each thread in the block handles one element, but if N is larger than 128, then multiple blocks would be needed for that row. Wait, but that's not possible. Because each row is processed by a single block. So, if the row has N elements, and the block has 128 threads, then each block can process 128 elements of the row. But that would require that the row is divided into chunks of 128 elements. However, that's not efficient for summing, because each thread would have to accumulate their part of the sum. But maybe that's manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element in the row. Then, for each row, the threads in the block process all elements. But that would require that the block size is equal to N, which is not feasible for large N.

Hmm. Maybe the kernel should be designed to process each row, and for each row, each thread in the block processes a single element. Then, the block's sum is the sum of all elements in the row. Then, the block's sum is divided by N to get the mean for that row.

But how to handle this in Triton.

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the mean along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the problem is to compute the mean of each row in a 2D tensor. Since the tensor is [M, N], each row has N elements, and we need to compute the average for each of the M rows. So, for each row, sum all elements and divide by N.

Now, thinking about GPU operations. Triton kernels are written in a way that's optimized for parallelism. So, I need to structure the kernel so that each thread handles a specific row. Each thread will process one row, sum its elements, and then divide by N.

Next, the input and output tensor shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output is a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the mean of the corresponding row.

Memory layout: The input tensor is stored in row-major order. Each thread will process a row, so for a given thread index, it will process the elements from column 0 to N-1 of that row.

Optimal block sizes: Since each thread processes a row, the block size should be such that each thread is responsible for a single row. So, the number of threads per block should be equal to the number of rows, M. But since Triton's blocks can have multiple threads, perhaps we can set the block size to a value that allows each thread to handle one row. Wait, but in Triton, the block size is determined by the number of threads per block. So, if M is large, we need to have enough threads per block. But for a 2D tensor, each row is processed by a single thread. So, the number of threads per block would be the number of rows, but that's not feasible if M is large. Wait, no. Actually, the kernel is written such that each thread handles one row. So, the number of threads per block would be the number of rows, but that's not possible if M is large. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again.

In Triton, the kernel is launched with a grid of blocks, and each block has a certain number of threads. For this problem, each row is processed by a single thread. So, the number of threads per block would be the number of rows, but that's not possible if M is large. Wait, no. Actually, the kernel is written with a grid of blocks, and each block processes a subset of the rows. But for this problem, since each row is independent, we can have each thread process one row. So, the number of threads per block is the number of rows, but that's not efficient. Alternatively, the number of threads per block is set to a value that allows each thread to process one row. But how?

Wait, perhaps the block size is determined by the number of rows. For example, if M is 1024, then each block can have 1024 threads, but that's not efficient. So, maybe the block size is set to a value that's a power of two, like 1024, and the number of blocks is M / block_size. But that's not the case here. Wait, perhaps the kernel is written in a way that each thread is responsible for a single row. So, for each row, the thread will process all elements in that row. So, the kernel will have a loop over the rows, and for each row, loop over the columns.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let's think of the kernel as follows: each thread is assigned a row index. Then, for that row, the thread sums all the elements in that row. Then, the sum is divided by N to get the mean.

So, the steps for each thread:

1. Get the row index (i) from the thread index.
2. For each column j in 0 to N-1:
   a. Load the value from input[i][j]
   b. Add it to the sum.
3. After summing all elements in the row, divide by N to get the mean.
4. Store the mean in the output tensor at position i.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let's think about the kernel parameters. The kernel will need to know the input tensor, the output tensor, the dimensions M and N. Also, the kernel will need to know the number of rows (M) and columns (N).

In Triton, the kernel is written with a grid of blocks and a number of threads per block. For this problem, each thread is responsible for a single row. So, the number of threads per block is the number of rows, but that's not efficient. Alternatively, the number of threads per

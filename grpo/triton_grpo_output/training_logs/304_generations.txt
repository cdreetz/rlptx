Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum each column of the 2D tensor. So for each column (which is the last dimension), we need to add up all the elements in that column. The output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the sum of the corresponding column in the input.

Next, input and output tensor shapes. The input is [M, N], and the output is [M]. The memory layout is probably row-major, so each row is contiguous in memory. For a 2D tensor, the elements are stored as [0, 0], [0, 1], ..., [0, N-1], [1, 0], etc.

Now, optimal block sizes and memory access. Since we're processing columns, each thread should handle one column. But how to organize the threads? Maybe each thread block handles a single column. Wait, but for a 2D tensor, if we have M rows and N columns, each column has M elements. So for each column, we need to sum M elements. So each thread block can process one column. But how many threads per block? Let's think about the number of threads per block. If each thread is responsible for one element in the column, then each thread would process one element. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread block process a range of elements in the column. But since the column is of length M, and each thread block can process a certain number of elements, perhaps we can use a block size that divides M. However, since M can be arbitrary, maybe it's better to have each thread process one element in the column. But that would require a lot of threads. Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread block process a single column, and each thread in the block processes one element in that column. Wait, but that might not be efficient. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the kernel can be structured such that each thread block processes a single column. For example, if the number of columns is N, then each thread block handles one column. But that would require N thread blocks. However, in Triton, the kernel is launched with a certain number of blocks, so perhaps the number of blocks is determined by the number of columns. But in this case, the output is [M], so each column is summed. So the number of blocks should be equal to the number of columns, N. But that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread block processes a single column, and each thread in the block processes one element in that column. But how to arrange that.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the kernel as processing each column. So for each column, we need to sum all the elements in that column. So the kernel can be structured with each thread block handling one column. The number of thread blocks would be N, the number of columns. Each thread block would process one column. Then, within each thread block, each thread would process one element in that column. But how to do that.

Alternatively, perhaps each thread block handles a single column, and each thread in the block processes one element in that column. So for a column with M elements, each thread block would have M threads. But that would require that the number of threads per block is M. But M could be large, so that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe the block size is set to a fixed value, like 256, and each thread processes a single element. But that would require that the number of threads per block is M, which might not be possible if M is larger than the block size.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the problem differently. Let's consider that for each column, we need to sum all elements. So for each column index j (from 0 to N-1), we need to sum all elements in row i, column j for i from 0 to M-1.

So the kernel should iterate over each column j, and then for each row i in that column, add the value to the sum.

But how to structure this in Triton. Triton kernels are typically written with a loop over the grid of blocks, and each block processes a certain range of elements. So perhaps the kernel is structured with a loop over the columns, and for each column, the threads process the elements in that column.

But how to do that. Let's think of the kernel as follows:

The kernel is launched with a grid of blocks. Each block is responsible for a single column. For each column j, the block processes all elements in that column. So the number of blocks is N, the number of columns. Each block

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the sum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to sum each column of the tensor. So for each column (which is along the N dimension), I need to add up all the elements in that column. Since it's a 2D tensor, each row is M elements, and there are N columns.

Next, the input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [N], where each element is the sum of the corresponding column.

Now, considering the Triton kernel structure. Triton kernels are written with a @triton.jit decorator. The kernel needs to process elements in blocks. For a sum reduction, I need to process each column and accumulate the sum. So, each thread should handle a specific column.

What's the optimal block size? Since each column is processed independently, maybe each thread can handle one column. But wait, in Triton, threads are usually grouped into warps, and block size is often a multiple of the warp size (32). But for a sum reduction, perhaps each thread is responsible for a single column. However, if M is large, maybe we need to process multiple elements in a column per thread. Wait, no. For a sum reduction along the last dimension (N), each thread should process a single column. So for each column, the thread would iterate over all the rows (M elements) and sum them.

But how to structure this. Let's think about the kernel parameters. The input tensor is [M, N], and the output is [N]. So each thread would handle one column. So the kernel would have a loop over the columns, and for each column, sum all the elements in that column.

But how to map the thread index to the column. Let's say each thread is responsible for a single column. So the thread index in the block would correspond to the column index. But how to handle that. Let me think: the kernel is launched with a grid that has N threads, each handling one column. Then, for each column, the thread would iterate over all the rows (M elements) and sum them.

But wait, if M is large, then each thread would need to process M elements. But that's not efficient. Wait, no. Wait, the kernel is designed for a 2D tensor. So perhaps the kernel is structured with each thread processing a single element in the column. Wait, no. Let me think again.

The problem is to compute the sum of each column. So for each column j (from 0 to N-1), sum all elements in column j, which are at positions (i, j) for i from 0 to M-1.

So, the kernel should have each thread handle one column. So the number of threads per block would be N. But if N is large, then the block size would be N, which might not be optimal. Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured with each thread processing a single element in the column, but that would require more threads.

Wait, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread is responsible for a single column. So, for each column j, the thread would iterate over all the rows i, and add the value at (i, j) to the sum. But that would require each thread to process M elements. However, if M is large, this could be slow. But maybe that's the way to do it.

Alternatively, perhaps the kernel is structured with each thread handling a block of elements in the column. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread could process 32 elements in the column. But that would require the kernel to be designed with a loop over the elements in the column, and each thread handles a chunk of them. However, that would complicate the code, but maybe it's more efficient.

But for the purpose of this problem, maybe the simplest way is to have each thread handle a single column, and then sum all elements in that column. Let's proceed with that approach.

So, the kernel would have a loop over the columns. Each thread is responsible for one column. Then, for each column, the thread would iterate over all the rows and sum them.

But how to structure this in Triton. Let's think about the kernel parameters. The input tensor is a 2D tensor. The kernel would need to process each column. So, the kernel would have a loop over the columns, and for each column, sum the elements.

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The user mentioned using tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that matrix multiplication involves computing each element of the resulting matrix as the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix. But with large matrices, doing this directly would be inefficient. So, using tile-based computation with shared memory makes sense to optimize memory access and reduce latency.

The two input tensors are A (M x K) and B (K x N). The output tensor C will be M x N. Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

In Triton, I'll need to use shared memory to store tiles of the input matrices. The idea is to split the matrices into smaller blocks (tiles) that fit into shared memory, then compute the dot product for each tile.

Let me think about the block sizes. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 elements is common. Let's choose a block size of 32. So, each thread will handle a block of size 32x32. But wait, the actual block size depends on the dimensions of the matrices. Maybe I should use a block size that allows for efficient computation of the dot product. For example, if each thread computes a block of K elements, then the block size for K would be 32. But I need to make sure that the tiles fit into shared memory.

So, the shared memory will store a tile of A and a tile of B. Each tile is of size (block_size x block_size). For A, which is M x K, each tile will be (block_size x block_size), but K might be larger than block_size. Similarly for B, which is K x N.

Wait, the dimensions of the matrices are M x K and K x N. So, for the first matrix A, each tile is of size (block_size x block_size), and for B, it's (block_size x block_size). But the actual dimensions need to be handled properly.

The key steps are:

1. Load the input matrices into shared memory in tiles.
2. For each tile of A and B, compute the dot product for the corresponding elements in the output matrix.
3. Accumulate the results in the output matrix.

But how to handle the indices? Let me think about the thread indices. Each thread will compute a certain part of the output matrix. For example, each thread might be responsible for a particular element in the output matrix, but that's not efficient. Instead, using a tile-based approach, each thread block processes a block of the output matrix.

Alternatively, using a block size that allows for each thread to compute a portion of the dot product. For example, each thread computes a certain number of elements in the dot product. Let me think about the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton.

In the standard approach, each thread block processes a block of the output matrix. For each element C[i][j], the thread block computes it by loading a tile of A and a tile of B, then computing the dot product. However, this might not be efficient for large K. So, using a tile size of K (or a multiple of K) might be better.

Alternatively, the tile size is chosen such that each thread block can process a block of K elements. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread block processes 32 elements in K. Then, each thread in the block would compute a part of the dot product.

Wait, perhaps I need to structure the kernel such that each thread block handles a block of A and a block of B, and computes the corresponding block of C. Let me outline the steps:

- The kernel is launched with a grid that covers all the rows of C (M) and columns of C (N). But that's not efficient. Instead, the kernel should be structured such that each thread block handles a block of C.

But maybe that's getting too complicated. Let's refer to standard Triton matrix multiplication examples. In the standard example, the kernel is structured with each thread block handling a block of the output matrix. For example, each thread block is responsible for computing a block of size (block_size x block_size) in the output matrix. Then, for each element in that block, the thread block computes it by loading tiles of A and B.

But in this case, since the matrices are M x K and K x N, the output is M x N. So, the kernel needs to process each element of C. However, with large M and N, this would be too slow. So, using a tile-based approach where each thread block processes a block of K elements in A and a

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me start by recalling how matrix multiplication works in Triton.

First, the input tensors are A (M x K) and B (K x N). The result is C (M x N), where each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. 

In Triton, I need to handle this with shared memory to optimize memory access. The key is to tile the matrices into blocks that fit into shared memory. Typically, for matrix multiplication, you use a block size that's a multiple of the matrix dimensions, but since we're using shared memory, the block size should be chosen such that each thread block can handle a tile of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) in the matrices.

Wait, the standard approach is to use a block size that's a multiple of the matrix dimensions. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread block can handle a 32x32 tile of the matrix. But since the matrices are A (M x K) and B (K x N), the block size should be chosen such that each thread block can process a tile of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) in both matrices.

But I need to make sure that the shared memory is used efficiently. So, each thread block will load a tile of A and a tile of B into shared memory, then perform the multiplication. The threads in the block will compute the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B.

So, the steps would be:

1. Determine the block size. Let's say BLOCK_SIZE = 32. This is a common choice for Triton kernels.

2. For each thread in the block, compute the index in the tile. The threads will be responsible for computing a specific element in the result matrix.

3. Load the A and B tiles into shared memory. Since A is M x K and B is K x N, the tiles will be of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) for each.

Wait, but the tiles for A and B would be different. For example, the tile of A is (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), and the tile of B is (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). But when multiplying, each thread in the block will compute a dot product between a row of A and a column of B.

So, the threads in the block will be responsible for computing the dot product between a row of A and a column of B. Each thread will compute one element of the result matrix.

But how to organize the threads in the block? For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread block has 32x32 threads. Each thread will compute one element of the result matrix.

But wait, that's not efficient. Because for each element in the result matrix, you need to compute the sum over K elements. If the block size is 32, then each thread can compute one element of the result matrix, but that would require each thread to compute K elements, which is not feasible. So perhaps the correct approach is to have each thread compute a part of the dot product.

Alternatively, in the standard matrix multiplication with shared memory, each thread block handles a tile of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) in A and (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) in B. Then, each thread in the block computes a part of the dot product between the rows of A and columns of B. 

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the tiles. Let's say that the tile size is (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE). So, for matrix A (M x K), each tile is of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), and similarly for B (K x N). Then, the result matrix C is (M x N), and each tile of C is (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE).

But the actual computation would involve each thread in the block computing a part of the dot product. For example, each thread in the block is responsible for a particular element in the result matrix. However, that's not efficient because the dot product requires multiple elements.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to have each thread block compute a tile of the result matrix. For example, each thread block is responsible for computing a tile of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE) in the result matrix. Then, each thread in the block is responsible for computing a particular element in that tile. But how?

Alternatively, the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to use a block size that is a multiple of the matrix dimensions. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread block processes a tile of size (32, 32) in the matrices. The threads in the block are responsible for computing

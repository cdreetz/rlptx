Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the minimum reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, the input is a 2D tensor with dimensions M (rows) and N (columns). The goal is to find the minimum value along the last dimension, which means for each row (since the last dimension is N), we need to compute the minimum of all elements in that row. So, the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row in the input.

Now, thinking about how to implement this in Triton. Triton is a GPU programming language that allows writing kernels in a way similar to CUDA, but with more flexibility and better performance. The key is to structure the kernel to efficiently process the data using shared memory and proper memory access patterns.

Let me outline the steps:

1. **GPU Operations**: For each row in the input tensor, we need to find the minimum value. This is a reduction operation along the last dimension. Each row is processed independently, so we can process each row in parallel.

2. **Input/Output Shapes**: The input is [M, N], and the output is [M]. Each element in the output corresponds to a row in the input.

3. **Block Sizes and Memory Access**: Since each row is processed independently, we can structure the kernel such that each thread block handles one row. However, if N is large, we might need to split the processing of a row into multiple threads. Alternatively, each thread could handle a single element in the row, but that might not be efficient. Wait, for a row of N elements, if we have N threads per block, that could work. But if N is large, maybe we need to use a block size that can handle multiple elements per thread. Alternatively, using a block size that's a multiple of the number of elements per row. But since the kernel is per-row, maybe each thread block processes one row, and within that block, each thread processes one element in the row. However, for a row of N elements, if the block size is smaller than N, we might need to have multiple threads per block. Hmm, maybe it's better to have each thread handle one element in the row. So, for each row, we have N elements, and each thread handles one element. But that would require that the number of threads per block is equal to N, which might not be efficient if N is large. Alternatively, we can use a block size that's a multiple of the number of elements per row, but that might not be feasible. Alternatively, we can process each row in a way that each thread block handles a subset of the elements in the row. Wait, but for reduction, we need to find the minimum, which is a reduction operation. So, perhaps each thread block processes a row, and within the block, the threads perform the reduction.

Wait, but for a row of N elements, the reduction can be done in a way similar to a standard reduction. For example, using a warp-level reduction. So, the kernel can be structured such that each thread block handles one row, and within the block, the threads perform the reduction.

So, the plan is:

- Each thread block processes one row (i.e., one row of the input tensor).
- For each row, the threads in the block perform a reduction to find the minimum.
- The output is stored in a separate tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Now, the memory layout. The input tensor is 2D, with shape [M, N]. So, each row is a 1D array of N elements. The output tensor is 1D of size M.

In Triton, the kernel will have to access the input tensor in a way that allows each thread to access the elements of a row. Let's assume that the input tensor is stored in a contiguous memory layout, which is the case for a 2D tensor.

For each row i, the elements are at positions i*N + j for j from 0 to N-1. So, in the kernel, each thread can be assigned a row index i, and then process the elements in that row.

But how to structure the threads. Let's think about the block size. Let's say we have a block size of, say, 128. For each row, we can have multiple threads processing different elements in the row. However, for reduction, we need to find the minimum, which requires that each thread processes a portion of the elements and combines the results.

Alternatively, perhaps each thread block is responsible for processing a single row, and within the block, the threads perform a reduction. For example, if the row has N elements, and the block has B threads, then each thread can process a portion of

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the min reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, the input is a 2D tensor with dimensions M (rows) and N (columns). The task is to compute the minimum value along the last dimension, which means for each row (since the last dimension is N), we need to find the minimum of all elements in that row. So the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Now, thinking about how to implement this in Triton. Triton kernels are written in a way that's similar to CUDA, but with more abstraction. The key is to figure out how to process each row and compute the minimum.

Let me outline the steps:

1. **GPU Operations**: For each row in the input tensor, find the minimum value. So, for each row, we need to iterate through all elements in that row and track the minimum.

2. **Input/Output Shapes**: The input is [M, N], output is [M]. The input is a 2D tensor, and the output is a 1D tensor with M elements.

3. **Block Sizes and Memory Access**: Since we're processing rows, each block can handle one row. But how many blocks do we need? Well, the number of blocks would be equal to the number of rows, M. Each block processes one row. However, in Triton, the number of blocks is determined by the number of rows. But since each block can process a row, we can have each block handle one row.

Wait, but in Triton, the kernel is launched with a certain number of blocks. So, for M rows, we can launch M blocks, each handling one row. Each block will process the elements in that row.

But how to structure the kernel. Let me think about the parameters. The kernel will need to know the input tensor, the output tensor, the dimensions M and N. But in Triton, the kernel is written with parameters that are passed in, so perhaps the kernel will take the input and output tensors, and the dimensions.

But in the kernel code, the parameters would be passed as arguments. So, the kernel function would be something like:

@triton.jit
def kernel(...):

But the exact parameters need to be determined. Let's think about the parameters. The input is a 2D tensor, so we need to pass it as a pointer, and the output is a 1D tensor. Also, the dimensions M and N are needed.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with the parameters, so the kernel function would have parameters like input, output, M, N, and maybe other parameters like block size.

But the main thing is, for each row, we need to find the minimum. So, for each row, the block will process all elements in that row.

Now, for each block, we can assign a row index. Let's say the block index is i, which corresponds to the row. Then, for that row, we need to iterate over all columns (from 0 to N-1) and find the minimum.

But how to handle this in Triton. Let me think about the kernel's logic.

Each block will handle one row. The block index is i. Then, for that row, we need to find the minimum of the elements in that row.

So, for each row i, the elements are at input[i, j], for j from 0 to N-1.

So, the kernel will have to iterate over each element in the row and track the minimum.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with a loop over the elements. So, for each block, we can have a loop over the columns of the row.

But how to structure this. Let's think about the kernel's parameters. The kernel will be called with the input and output tensors, and the dimensions M and N.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with the parameters, so the function signature would be something like:

@triton.jit
def min_reduction(input, output, M, N, ...):

But the exact parameters depend on how we structure the kernel.

Now, the kernel's code would be:

For each block, assign the row index i. Then, for that row, iterate over each column j, and find the minimum.

But in Triton, the kernel is written with the block index. So, the code would be something like:

@triton.jit
def kernel(input, output, M, N):
    row = tl.program_id(0)
    # For this row, find the minimum
    min_val = tl.full(0, float('inf'), dtype=tl.float32)
    for j in range(N):
        val = tl.load(input + row *

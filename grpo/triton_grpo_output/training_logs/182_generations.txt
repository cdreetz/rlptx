Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The user wants tile-based computation using shared memory. Let me break this down.

First, I remember that matrix multiplication involves computing each element of the resulting matrix as the dot product of a row from the first matrix and a column from the second matrix. But with large matrices, doing this naively would be too slow. So, using shared memory and tiling is the way to go.

So, the two input tensors are A (M x K) and B (K x N). The output tensor C will be M x N. Each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j].

In Triton, I need to structure the kernel to handle this efficiently. The key steps are:

1. Determine the block size. Typically, for matrix multiplication, a block size of 32 or 64 is common. Let's choose 32 for now. But I need to check if that's optimal for the given problem.

2. Use shared memory to store tiles of the input matrices. Each thread block will handle a portion of the output matrix. For each block, we'll load a tile of A and a tile of B into shared memory, compute the dot product, and store the result in C.

3. The threads in the block will be responsible for computing elements of the output matrix. Each thread might handle a specific element of C, but with tiling, each thread might compute a part of the dot product.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of how many threads per block. If each thread is responsible for a single element in the output matrix, that might not be efficient. Instead, using a tile-based approach where each thread block handles a block of the output matrix, and each thread computes a part of the dot product.

Alternatively, for each element in the output matrix, we can compute it by iterating over the K elements. But with K possibly being large, this could be slow. So, tiling the matrices into smaller blocks (like 32x32) and using shared memory to store these blocks.

Let me think about the memory layout. The input matrices A and B will be stored in shared memory. Each thread in the block will handle a portion of the tiles. For example, if the block size is 32, each thread might handle a 32x32 tile of A and B.

Wait, perhaps the kernel is structured such that each thread block computes a block of the output matrix. For example, if the output matrix is M x N, and each block handles a block of size (block_size, block_size), then the threads in the block would compute the dot products for that block.

But I need to make sure that the shared memory is properly used. Let me recall that in Triton, each thread block has its own shared memory, which is accessible by all threads in the block.

So, for the matrix multiplication, the steps would be:

- For each thread block, determine which part of the output matrix it is responsible for. Let's say the block is responsible for rows i to i + block_rows and columns j to j + block_cols.

- Load the corresponding tiles of A and B into shared memory. For example, if the block size is 32, then each tile of A is 32x32, and similarly for B.

- Then, compute the dot product between the tiles of A and B, and store the result in the corresponding part of the output matrix.

But how to handle the indices? Let me think about the parameters for the kernel.

The kernel needs to take the input tensors A and B, and the output tensor C. The kernel will be launched with the dimensions of the output matrix. But since we're using tile-based computation, the kernel will process tiles of A and B, and compute the corresponding tiles of C.

Alternatively, the kernel could be structured such that each thread is responsible for computing a single element of C. But that's not efficient for large K. So, using tiling is better.

Another approach is to have each thread block compute a block of the output matrix, and each thread in the block computes a part of the dot product. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread in the block handles a single element of the output matrix, but that's not efficient. Wait, no. Maybe each thread block handles a block of rows and columns in the output matrix, and for each element in that block, compute the dot product using the tiles of A and B.

Alternatively, the kernel could be structured such that each thread block handles a block of the output matrix, and each thread in the block is responsible for computing a single element of the output matrix. However, this would require that the threads in the block are arranged in a way that allows them to

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel for matrix multiplication of two tensors with shapes [M, K] and [K, N]. The goal is to use tile-based computation with shared memory. Let me think through the steps.

First, the problem is standard matrix multiplication. The first matrix is MxK, the second is KxN, so the result should be MxN. Each element in the result is the sum of the dot product of the corresponding row from the first matrix and column from the second.

In Triton, I need to handle this efficiently using shared memory. The key is to tile the matrices into blocks that fit into shared memory. Typically, for matrix multiplication, you use a block size that's a multiple of the matrix dimensions, but here since the matrices are [M,K] and [K,N], the block size should be chosen such that each thread block can handle a portion of the matrices.

Let me recall the standard approach. For each thread block, we can compute a block of the result matrix. Each thread in the block handles a small tile of the result. But how to split the matrices into tiles?

Assuming that the matrices are stored in row-major order. The first matrix (A) is MxK, and the second (B) is KxN. The result matrix C is MxN.

In shared memory, each thread block will load a tile of A and a tile of B. The tile size is usually determined by the block size. Let's say the block size is BLOCK_SIZE, which is a common choice like 32 or 128. But for matrix multiplication, the tile size is often chosen as the block size, so that each thread handles a small portion.

Wait, in the standard approach, each thread block computes a block of the result. For example, each thread block handles a tile of A (size block_rows x block_cols) and a tile of B (size block_cols x block_rows), but that might not fit here. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the matrix dimensions.

Alternatively, the standard approach for matrix multiplication in Triton is to have each thread block compute a block of the result matrix. Each thread in the block computes one element of the result. But that's not efficient. Instead, using a tile-based approach where each thread block processes a tile of the result matrix, and each thread computes a portion of that tile.

But perhaps I should think in terms of the following: for each thread block, we can load a tile of A (size block_rows x block_cols) and a tile of B (size block_cols x block_rows), and compute the dot product of each row of A with each column of B. However, since A is MxK and B is KxN, the tile size for A would be (block_rows x block_cols), and for B it would be (block_cols x block_rows), but that might not fit. Wait, maybe the tile size is determined by the block size. Let me think.

Let me consider that each thread block processes a block of the result matrix. For example, if the block size is 32, then each thread block handles a 32x32 tile of the result. But that's for when the result is MxN. However, in this case, the matrices A and B are MxK and KxN. So the tile size for A and B would need to be such that the product can be computed.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard approach is to split the matrices into tiles of size (BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE), and each thread block computes a tile of the result. But how?

However, since A is MxK and B is KxN, the tile size for A would be (block_rows x block_cols), and for B it would be (block_cols x block_rows). But this seems a bit conflicting.

Alternatively, the tile size is determined by the block size. Let's say the block size is 32. Then, each thread block can handle a tile of A (size 32x32) and a tile of B (size 32x32). But since A is MxK

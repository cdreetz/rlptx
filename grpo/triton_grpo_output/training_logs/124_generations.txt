Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the min reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the GPU operations. The task is to find the minimum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the minimum value). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the min of N elements.

Next, input and output shapes. The input is a 2D tensor of shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the minimum of the corresponding row.

Now, block sizes and memory access. Triton kernels use warps and threads. For a 2D tensor, each thread might process a single element. But since we need to find the min along the rows, each thread in a block can handle a single element in the row. However, since we need to compare all elements in the row, we need to make sure that all threads in a block process the same row. Wait, but how to organize the threads?

Wait, maybe each thread block processes a single row. So for each row (M), we have a thread block. But how to split the rows among blocks? Well, the number of blocks would be M, but that might not be efficient. Alternatively, maybe each block processes multiple rows, but that depends on the block size. Alternatively, perhaps each thread block processes a single row, and each thread in the block processes a single element in that row. But that might not be efficient in terms of memory access. Alternatively, maybe each thread block processes a single row, and each thread in the block is responsible for a single element in that row. But how to handle that.

Alternatively, think of it as for each row, we need to find the minimum. So for each row, we can have a thread block that processes all elements in that row. But how to organize the threads. Let's think about the grid and blocks.

Let me think about the kernel structure. The kernel should process each row. So the grid should have M blocks, each handling a row. Each block processes all elements in that row. But that's not efficient because each block would have to process N elements. However, with Triton, the block can have multiple threads, each handling one element in the row. But for a row of N elements, if the block has, say, 128 threads, then each thread would process one element. But that would require that each block is assigned to a row, and each thread in the block handles one element in that row. But how to organize the threads.

Alternatively, maybe each thread block processes a single row, and each thread in the block handles a single element in that row. So for a row with N elements, the block has N threads. But that's not efficient if N is large. However, in Triton, the number of threads per block is determined by the block size. So perhaps the block size is set to N, but that's not feasible if N is large. Alternatively, maybe the block size is set to a fixed number, say 128, and each block processes a range of elements in the row. But that might complicate the logic.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread block processes a single row, and each thread in the block processes a single element in that row. So for a row, the block has N threads, but that's not feasible for large N. Wait, but in Triton, the number of threads per block is determined by the block size. So perhaps the block size is set to a value that can handle the elements in the row. But that's not possible if the row length varies. However, in this case, the row length is N, which is fixed. So perhaps the block size is set to N, but that's not efficient for large N. Alternatively, maybe the block size is set to a fixed number, say 128, and each block processes a single row, with each thread in the block handling a single element in the row. But how to handle when N is not a multiple of the block size.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is designed to process each row, and for each row, the threads in the block process the elements in that row. So the grid has M blocks, each block processes a row. Each block has a certain number of threads, say 128, and each thread handles a single element in the row. But how to handle the case where the row has more elements than the number of threads in the block.

Wait, but in this case, the row has N elements. So if the block has 128 threads, then each block can process up to 128 elements in the row. But if N is larger than 12

Okay, I need to write a Triton kernel that computes the min reduction along the last dimension of a 2D tensor with shape [M, N]. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem is to find the minimum value along the last dimension (i.e., for each row in the 2D tensor, find the minimum element). So for each row (each M element), we need to compute the min of N elements.

Now, considering how Triton works, I need to structure the kernel to process these rows efficiently. The input is a 2D tensor with shape [M, N], and the output should be a 1D tensor of shape [M], where each element is the min of the corresponding row.

Next, I need to determine the memory layout. The input tensor is stored in row-major order, so each row is contiguous in memory. For each row, we need to process all N elements. The kernel will process each row in parallel, with each thread handling a specific row.

So, the kernel should have a loop over the rows (M) and for each row, loop over the elements (N). But in Triton, it's more efficient to have each thread handle a single element, but since we need to find the minimum, perhaps each thread can be responsible for a single row, and then compute the min across the elements in that row.

Wait, but for each row, there are N elements. So, for each row, we need to process all N elements. However, in a Triton kernel, each thread can process a single element. But if we have multiple threads per row, that might be efficient.

Alternatively, maybe we can have each thread handle a single row, and then for that row, compute the min. But how to do that efficiently.

Let me think about the block size. Let's say we have a block size of 128. Each block can process multiple rows. Wait, but each row has N elements. So, for a given row, the number of threads needed to process all N elements would be N. But if N is large, that might not be efficient. However, since the kernel is for a 2D tensor, maybe we can process each row in a way that each thread handles a single element in the row.

But for the min reduction, each thread would need to compare its element with the current minimum. So, for each row, we can have a thread per element, but that might not be efficient if N is large. Alternatively, we can have a block that processes all elements in a row, using a reduction approach.

Wait, but in Triton, each thread can process a single element. So for each row, we can have multiple threads, each handling one element. Then, we need to compute the min across all those elements.

But how to do that. Let's think: for each row, the threads would compute the min of the elements in that row. So, for a row, the threads would need to compute the min of all N elements.

So, the kernel would have a loop over the rows (M), and for each row, process all N elements. But how to structure that in Triton.

Alternatively, maybe the kernel is structured such that each thread handles a single row, and then for that row, compute the min. But how to process the elements in the row.

Wait, perhaps the kernel is structured with each thread handling a single row. Then, for that row, the thread would need to iterate over all N elements and find the minimum. But that would require a loop inside the kernel for each row. But for large N, that could be inefficient.

Alternatively, maybe we can use a reduction approach. For each row, we can have a number of threads that process the elements in the row, and then reduce them to find the min. But how to do that.

Let me think about the block size. Let's say that each block handles a single row. For each row, the block has multiple threads that process the elements in the row. For example, if the block size is 128, then for a row with N elements, each thread would process a chunk of elements, and then reduce them.

But this approach might be more efficient. So, for each row, the threads in the block would process the elements in that row, and then compute the min.

But how to structure that. Let's consider that for each row, the threads are responsible for a certain range of elements in the row. Then, they perform a reduction to find the min.

But perhaps the more straightforward approach is to have each thread handle a single element in the row, and then use a reduction to find the min. However, for large N, this could be inefficient because each thread would have to compare with others.

Alternatively, maybe for each row, the kernel can be structured such that each thread is responsible for a single element, and then the threads

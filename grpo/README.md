# Data

- mix of kernelbench and generated kernels for same algo

# Rewards

- 2.0 compiles and correct against cpu version
- 1.0 flops above avg or baseline
- -1.0 non compile

- reward for min loc?
- reward for utilizing key optimization methods

# Utils

- benchmark suite for
  - flops
  - bandwith?
  -

# Future Work

- v1 is just rewards for writing correct and maybe performant kernels pass@1
- v2 is pass@20 (poor mans reasoning)
- v3 is reasoning/iterative approach (write kernel, benchmark, improve kernel, benchmrk, so on..)

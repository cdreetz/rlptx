Read the following pytorch model and implement it as a python triton kernel.

Your output should include a method named 'triton_kernel' that implements the kernel
and a 'triton_wrapper' method that runs the kernel.
It is important that you name the methods exactly as specified.
You don't need to provide any explanatory text, just the code methods listed above.

In this revised code, the class `TransposedConv3DFunctional` has been created to implement a 3D transposed convolution. It follows the guidelines by providing a clear docstring, importing necessary packages at the beginning, and using a `run_tests` function to demonstrate its correctness with examples, similar to the given code snippet. This approach avoids the use of `torch.nn.functional.conv_transpose3d` while still adhering to the `@staticmethod` and `@property` usage styles.

By using the `nn.ConvTranspose3d` class, you get the flexibility to define the number of input channels (`in_channels`), the number of output channels (`out_channels`), kernel size (`kernel_size`), stride (`stride`), padding (`padding`), and groups (`groups`) for the transposed convolution layer. This class is ideal for tasks that involve upsampling data, such as data augmentation for image classification or reconstruction tasks in generative models. The `forward` method is specifically designed for performing 3D transposed convolution, making it perfect for operations on 3D data.

In this code, the `ConvTranspose3D` class inherits from `nn.Module`. It defines a 3D transposed convolution operation with optional padding, stride, groups, and bias. The `__init__` method sets up these parameters as attributes. The `forward` method applies the transposed convolution layer to the input tensor.

The `get_inputs` function creates a batch of input tensors, while `get_init_inputs` is a lambda function that returns the required parameters for the convolution operation.

To use this class, you can create an instance and pass input tensors to the `forward` method.

You can use these classes and functions in your code like this:

x = get_inputs()
output = model(x)
print(output.shape)
```

Note that the `get_init_inputs` function is specifically designed for getting the initial inputs to your model's constructor, assuming the input dimensions are known. If you need to dynamically calculate the input dimensions, you might need to adjust the dimensions and the corresponding sizes of `depth`, `height`, `width` according to the input pattern and the expected output.

###### ORIGINAL PROMPT #####

You are a helpful assistant tasked with writing PyTorch code as Triton kernels.

            Name the kernel method as "triton_kernel" and the wrapper as "tritton_wrapper".

            Example:
            ```python
            import triton
            import triton.language as tl

            @triton.jit
            def triton_kernel(
                a_ptr, b_ptr, c_ptr, 
                stride_am, stride_ak, stride_bn, 
                stride_bk, stride_cm, stride_cn, 
                BLOCK_SIZE_M: tl.constexpr,  BLOCK_SIZE_N: tl.constexpr, BLOCK_SIZE_K: tl.constexpr
                ...

            def triton_wrapper(A, B):
                ...
                return C
            ```

            Your output should include a 'triton_kernel' and a 'triton_wrapper' method.
            You don't need to explain anything just write the kernel and wrapper.

1. **Define the ConvTranspose2d class**: This class inherits from `nn.ConvTranspose2d` from PyTorch, which is a standard convolutional transpose layer. It includes methods to initialize the layer with specified parameters and forward pass for handling transposed convolution.

2. **Initialization Parameters**:
    - `in_channels`: The number of input channels.
    - `out_channels`: The number of output channels.
    - `kernel_size`: The kernel size for the convolution in each dimension.
    - `stride`: The stride of the convolution in each dimension.
    - `padding`: The zero-padding size added before a convolutional layer.
    - `dilation`: The dilation factor for the convolution.
    - `groups`: The number of groups to divide input and output tensor across the channels.

3. **ConvTranspose2d forward method**: This method takes an input tensor and reshapes it using the defined convolve2d_transpose layer for transposed convolution.

4. **Test Code**:
   - Generates input tensors using `get_inputs` and `get_init_inputs`.
   - Calls the `get_outputs` function to obtain the output of the forward pass of the ConvTranspose2d layer.

5. **Calling the Model**:
   - The test code initializes the model with the defined parameters and tests whether the output is shaped correctly.

By ensuring careful implementation of the ConvTranspose2d class parameters and the forward pass behavior, the designed model ensures accurate handling of transposed 2D convolutions as specified. This model can then be further utilized in various deep learning applications, particularly those requiring the inverse of standard convolution operations. The provided test code verifies the functionality with a simple set of input shapes and dimensions.

In this solution, we define the `TransposedConv2d` class that inherits from the `nn.ConvTranspose2d` class from the official PyTorch documentation. The constructor of the `TransposedConv2d` class is overridden to accept additional arguments for kernel size, stride, padding, dilation, and groups. The method `forward` simply calls the `forward` method of the underlying `nn.ConvTranspose2d` layer with the appropriate input tensor. The test code function `get_inputs` generates a random tensor of shape `(batch_size, in_channels, height, width)` and returns the inputs needed to instantiate the `TransposedConv2d` object, whereas `get_init_inputs` returns the parameters for initializing the `TransposedConv2d` object.

To use the `ConvTranspose2D` class, you would typically create an instance and pass it the input and other necessary parameters like the output size. Remember, the `ConvTranspose2D` class is a more advanced version of the standard `nn.ConvTranspose2d` layer, offering additional flexibility and customization options. This allows for more complex transformations in your network models. Here is an example of how you might use this class in a custom module that you might extend for a larger neural network model:

```python
from torch import nn
from src.nn import ConvTranspose2D

class CustomConvTranspose2dModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, config, inputs):
        super(CustomConvTranspose2dModule, self).__init__()
        self.config = config
        self.model = nn.ModuleList([ConvTranspose2D(*input_size, out_channels, **config) for input_size in inputs])
    
    def forward(self, x):
        for module in self.model:
            x = module(x)
        return x

def get_config():
    return {
        'conv_transpose2d/kernel_size': [2, 3],
        'conv_transpose2d/stride': [1, 2],
        'conv_transpose2d/padding': [0, 1],
        'conv_transpose2d/dilation': [0, 1],
        'conv_transpose2d/stride': [(2, 2), (4, 5)],
        'conv_transpose2d/output_channels': [64, 128]
    }

def get_inputs():
    return [
        [batch_size, in_channels, *size] 
        for size in [
            (height, width),
            (height // 2, width // 2),
            (height // 4, width // 4)
        ]
    ]

def get_init_inputs():
    return [
        in_channels, 
        out_channels, 
        kernel_size, 
        stride, 
        padding, 
        dilation, 
        groups
    ]
```

In this custom module, `CustomConvTranspose2dModule`, you can wrap the `ConvTranspose2D` layer according to your neural architecture. The `get_config` and `get_inputs` functions help define the necessary input sizes required for the transformation, while the `get_init_inputs` function provides the initial configuration parameters. Remember, this is a simplified example, and you can extend or modify this module to fit your specific model needs.
